To avoid security vulnerabilities in this code block, ensure that all buffer-related operations have boundary checks in place before accessing or writing to the buffers. Specifically, verify that any calculated offsets and lengths do not exceed the size of their respective buffers or the total length of the payload to prevent buffer overflow and other memory-related issues.
