Ensure that before accessing or processing data from a buffer, you verify the buffer's length to ensure it includes sufficient space for all intended operations, such as reading headers or content sizes. Specifically, perform boundary checks early in the process to confirm that the required data segments fit within the buffer's actual size, preventing any overflow conditions.
