Ensure that when default conditions are met, such as when both `InputFmt` and `OutputFormat` are zero, appropriate non-null function pointers are assigned to `p->FromInput` and `p->ToOutput`, preventing them from being null. This prevents dereferencing null pointers and maintains program stability by using default handlers or functions like `UnrollNothing` and `PackNothing` as valid, non-null assignments.
