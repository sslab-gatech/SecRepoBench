To prevent issues with uninitialized variables, ensure that any allocated resources such as dynamically allocated objects are properly initialized before their use. In this situation, leveraging smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` can help manage memory automatically and ensure that resources are properly initialized and released, reducing the risk of leaving variables in an undefined state.
