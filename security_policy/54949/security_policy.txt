To prevent unintended memory reuse in this context, ensure that any pointer referencing freed memory is immediately set to NULL after the memory is deallocated. This practice ensures that subsequent operations on the original pointer do not inadvertently access invalid or reallocated memory, maintaining program stability and security.
