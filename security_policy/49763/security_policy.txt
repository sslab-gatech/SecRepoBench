To prevent a buffer overflow in this code block, ensure that you verify the size of the buffer before starting the loop. Specifically, make sure that the size of `xd` is greater than or equal to `ydigits` to guarantee that the operations within the loop do not attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This validation ensures that the code operates within the bounds of allocated memory, preventing overwriting unintended memory areas.
