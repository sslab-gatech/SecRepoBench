Ensure that you validate the number of input and output channels for both matrices to confirm they adhere to expected constraints (such as being set to 3 for RGB channels). This check helps prevent mismatches that could lead to buffer overflow situations when multiplying matrices, safeguarding against overwriting memory allocations on the heap.
