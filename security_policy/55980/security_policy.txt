To avoid potential buffer overflow issues, ensure that the buffer is only filled with data when there is enough input available to safely populate it. Specifically, check that the number of bytes available to read from the input is at least as many as you intend to process before attempting to access or manipulate them, as this prevents reading past the input's end and causing unintended behavior.
