Ensure that the memory allocation for the buffer is sufficiently large to accommodate all necessary elements, including any additional space required for computations or adjustments, to prevent exceeding the allocated memory limits. In this situation, verify that the calculated size accounts for all intended elements and any extra capacity needed, as demonstrated by the adjustment from a smaller to a slightly larger buffer allocation.
