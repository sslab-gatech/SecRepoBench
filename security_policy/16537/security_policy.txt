Ensure that any operations involving memory pointers occur after the memory allocation checks and error handling routines are completed, guaranteeing that all pointers reference valid, allocated memory before use. Re-compute or update pointers only after confirming that the required memory allocations have succeeded and are error-free, to prevent referencing memory that may have been reallocated or released.
