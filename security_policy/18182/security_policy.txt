To prevent the buffer overflow, ensure that the profile data is safely converted and handled by encapsulating it in a structure that maintains length information, such as using a `StringInfo` object, which helps manage memory safely and checks bounds before accessing the data. Additionally, always verify that any operation involving memory manipulation or string handling is performed within the allocated limits to prevent writing beyond the intended memory region.
