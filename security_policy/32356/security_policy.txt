To prevent the issue of accessing memory after it has been freed, ensure that any memory allocated to an object is properly freed and the object is either no longer used or is re-initialized appropriately. Additionally, include checks or conditions to handle cases where a freed object might be referenced again, such as validating object integrity and returning error codes if an invalid state is detected.
