Ensure that any operations involving buffer access are accompanied by checks for any potential errors or abnormal conditions that could affect the buffer's integrity. This can be achieved by incorporating an error-handling mechanism to verify the correctness of operations, such as validating object indices to ensure they are not in an erroneous state before proceeding with buffer manipulations.
