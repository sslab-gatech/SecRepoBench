Before using `codeccontext->sub_charenc`, ensure that its memory allocation and length are properly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access, particularly when dealing with external input that could potentially exceed buffer limits. Additionally, incorporate checks that verify the initialization of codec properties to handle scenarios where the context might be improperly configured, as demonstrated by the conditional check on `codeccontext->bits_per_coded_sample`.
