To avoid the security vulnerability in the code, ensure that direct pointer arithmetic and casting to manipulate memory are avoided, as these can lead to unsafe memory access. Instead, use functions like `memcpy` to safely handle data copying and maintain checks on the boundaries of the memory being accessed, ensuring that operations stay within allocated buffer limits.
