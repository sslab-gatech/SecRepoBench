The following code block contains CWE 122: A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

```c
if(header->caplen < iphdroffset + ip_len + sizeof(struct ndpi_vxlanhdr)) {
    return false;
  }
  u_int32_t vxlan_dst_port  = ntohs(4789);
  struct ndpi_udphdr *udp = (struct ndpi_udphdr *)&packet[iphdroffset+ip_len];
  u_int offset = iphdroffset + ip_len + sizeof(struct ndpi_udphdr);
  /**
   * rfc-7348 
   *    VXLAN Header:  This is an 8-byte field that has:

    - Flags (8 bits): where the I flag MUST be set to 1 for a valid
      VXLAN Network ID (VNI).  The other 7 bits (designated "R") are
      reserved fields and MUST be set to zero on transmission and
      ignored on receipt.

    - VXLAN Segment ID/VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI): this is a
      24-bit value used to designate the individual VXLAN overlay
      network on which the communicating VMs are situated.  VMs in
      different VXLAN overlay networks cannot communicate with each
      other.

    - Reserved fields (24 bits and 8 bits): MUST be set to zero on
      transmission and ignored on receipt.
         VXLAN Header:
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 122 but has the same functionality:
```c
if(header->caplen < iphdroffset + ip_len + sizeof(struct ndpi_udphdr) + sizeof(struct ndpi_vxlanhdr)) {
    return false;
  }
  u_int32_t vxlan_dst_port  = ntohs(4789);
  struct ndpi_udphdr *udp = (struct ndpi_udphdr *)&packet[iphdroffset+ip_len];
  u_int offset = iphdroffset + ip_len + sizeof(struct ndpi_udphdr);
  /**

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
