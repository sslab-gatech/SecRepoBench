To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this situation, ensure that any size calculations involving `obj->size` and `obj->address` are thoroughly checked against the available buffer size, ensuring they do not exceed `bit_chain->size` minus any necessary offsets like `oldpos`. Additionally, enforce a check to verify that the sum of `obj->size` and `obj->address` does not surpass the current byte position in `bit_chain`, thereby preventing the allocation of more memory than available.
