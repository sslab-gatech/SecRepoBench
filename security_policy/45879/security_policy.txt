To avoid dereferencing a null pointer in this context, ensure that any operations involving pointers, such as increments or modulo, are performed on valid, non-null pointers. Additionally, make sure that variables like `flb_malloc_p` are properly initialized and assigned valid memory before performing arithmetic operations or comparisons.
