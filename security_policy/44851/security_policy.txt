Ensure that loop iterations do not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory by adjusting the loop condition to prevent accessing out-of-range elements in the buffer. Specifically, when iterating through an array, adjust the loop condition to stop before the last element if needed, thus avoiding reading or writing beyond the allocated space.
