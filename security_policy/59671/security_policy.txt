To prevent reading data beyond the intended buffer in this code block, ensure that reference pointers like `ref_picture` are validated before use, such as by checking if they are non-null or contain expected data. Additionally, incorporate conditions that verify the validity and existence of any data being accessed, such as by confirming that essential pointers like `ref_picture[0]` are valid before proceeding with operations that rely on them.
