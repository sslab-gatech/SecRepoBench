Ensure that no memory is accessed or used after it has been freed by systematically tracking and nullifying any pointers referencing the freed memory before reusing or reallocating it. Additionally, avoid any conditional branches that may inadvertently reuse pointers referencing freed memory by ensuring such operations are performed in a controlled, linear sequence without deviation.
