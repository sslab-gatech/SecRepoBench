Ensure that the `prev_sibling` and `next_sibling` pointers of the `child` node are checked for `NULL` before attempting to modify their linked nodes. This precaution helps prevent accessing invalid memory if the `child` node is isolated without siblings, thus avoiding unintended behavior after the memory is freed.
