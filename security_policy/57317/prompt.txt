The following code block contains CWE 787: The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

```c
struct ndpi_packet_struct *packet = &detectionmodulestruct->packet;
  u_int16_t num_found = 0, i;
  char buffer[64] = { '\0' }, rdnSeqBuf[2048];
  u_int rdn_len = 0;

  rdnSeqBuf[0] = '\0';
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 787 but has the same functionality:
```c
struct ndpi_packet_struct *packet = &detectionmodulestruct->packet;
  u_int16_t num_found = 0;
  int32_t i;
  char buffer[64] = { '\0' }, rdnSeqBuf[2048];
  u_int rdn_len = 0;

  rdnSeqBuf[0] = '\0';
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
