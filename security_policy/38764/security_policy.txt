Ensure that all pointer arithmetic takes into account buffer boundaries by including additional checks that guarantee pointers do not exceed buffer limits. Specifically, verify that any access to an offset or an index within the buffer remains within the allocated memory bounds by performing necessary checks before dereferencing pointers, especially when calculating dynamic offsets.
