Ensure that when calculating or using an array index, such as those involving the `tk` or `round_key` arrays, the indices are validated to guarantee they fall within valid array boundaries. This includes checking that `rconpointer` remains within the limits of the `rcon` array and confirming that calculated indices from expressions like `(i + 1) & 3` or `rounds - i` are verified to prevent accessing elements outside their respective array sizes.
