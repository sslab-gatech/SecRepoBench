To avoid the security vulnerability in this code block, ensure that all buffer size calculations and memory allocations are validated against the maximum allowable bounds before performing any operations that involve copying data into buffers. Additionally, it's important to handle any potential edge cases, such as negative values or values that exceed buffer limits, with appropriate error handling to prevent any buffer from being overwritten.
