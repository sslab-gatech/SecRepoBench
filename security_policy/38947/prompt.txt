The following code block contains CWE 121: A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

```cpp
// get file format version and print to log
    ++elementIter;
    
    if ((*elementIter).tokens[0].empty()) {
        ASSIMP_LOG_ERROR("Invalid LWS file detectedm abort import.");
        return;
    }
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 121 but has the same functionality:
```cpp
// get file format version and print to log
    ++elementIter;

    if (elementIter == root.children.end() || (*elementIter).tokens[0].empty()) {
        ASSIMP_LOG_ERROR("Invalid LWS file detectedm abort import.");
        return;
    }
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
