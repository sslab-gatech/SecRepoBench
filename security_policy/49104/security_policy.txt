Ensure that all accesses to the buffer are carefully bounded by checking that offsets and lengths do not exceed the size of the buffer. Implement a dedicated function that encapsulates these checks, such as verifying if the buffer contains enough space before accessing or comparing data, to centralize the responsibility and reduce the risk of oversight.
