Ensure that when processing and modifying buffers, you consistently track the remaining length of the buffer to prevent overstepping its bounds. Incorporate checks to decrement and verify the buffer's length before advancing pointers, especially when skipping or searching through data, to prevent accessing memory outside the allocated space.
