Ensure that any loop index, such as `i`, is properly constrained within safe bounds by using functions like `min` to compare against maximum allowable limits, especially when dealing with nested loops. This approach prevents the loop from accessing or manipulating array elements beyond their valid range, thus maintaining safe array indexing.
