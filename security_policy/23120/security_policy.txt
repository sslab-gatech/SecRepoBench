To avoid potential invalid memory access when dealing with node attributes, ensure that after a node is deregistered, it is not accessed or modified again until you are certain that the memory has not been reallocated or reused elsewhere. This can be achieved by consistently checking and updating any references to the node, especially after memory management operations, to prevent accessing stale pointers.
