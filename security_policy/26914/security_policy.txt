Ensure that the character being processed is within the valid range of unsigned char values before applying functions like `tolower` or `tolower_l`, thereby preventing reading past the intended buffer. This can be done by checking if the character code does not exceed the bounds of an unsigned char, which prevents undefined behavior when handling EOF or other out-of-range values.
