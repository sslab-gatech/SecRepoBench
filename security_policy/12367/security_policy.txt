Ensure that the values derived from the buffer, such as `nb_slices` and `slice_height`, are validated to prevent arithmetic operations from leading to out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically, verify that `nb_slices` multiplied by `slice_height` does not exceed the expected dimensions, and confirm that offsets and sizes fall within the bounds of the buffer to prevent reading past its end.
