Ensure that any assignment or modification of pointers is done carefully to prevent multiple deallocations of the same memory address. Specifically, reset or nullify any pointer that is being freed, such as resetting `attr->name` to NULL after assigning its value to another pointer, to prevent accidental reuse or repeated freeing of the same memory space.
