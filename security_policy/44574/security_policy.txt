To avoid the heap overflow condition in this code block, ensure that pointer arithmetic and boundary checks are conducted correctly, particularly when checking the end of the string buffer. Validate that all pointer increments do not exceed the bounds of the string, especially when accessing subsequent characters, to prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer.
