Ensure that any operations involving entries, such as those performed on `entry_result->astr`, properly check and respect buffer boundaries to prevent overflow. Additionally, maintain clear conditions and manage control flow carefully, such as breaking out of loops when necessary and resetting variables like `cmin` and `cmax` to their initial values to avoid unintended overwrites.
