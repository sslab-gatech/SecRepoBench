To prevent writing beyond the buffer, ensure that the new length calculation doesn't result in an overflow by verifying that the sum of the current length, the length of the new data, and any additional space needed doesn't exceed the maximum allowable value for the data type. This safeguard helps avoid unintended memory access by ensuring the combined length remains within valid bounds before performing memory reallocation or data copying.
