Ensure that all necessary variables such as `len`, `cmin`, and `cmax` are consistently updated and maintained to reflect the correct boundaries and sizes of data structures before using them in operations. This practice prevents situations where the buffer might be accessed or modified beyond its allocated space, thereby avoiding overflow conditions.
