The following code block contains CWE 1284: The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

```c
if (csv_stream == NULL) {
									/* the enclosure is unterminated */
									if (bptr > limit) {
										/* if the line ends with enclosure, we need to go back by
										 * one character so the \0 character is not copied. */
										--bptr;
									}
									goto quit_loop_2;
								}

								size_t new_len;
								char *new_buf = php_stream_get_line(csv_stream, NULL, 0, &new_len);
								if (!new_buf) {
									/* we've got an unterminated enclosure,
									 * assign all the data from the start of
									 * the enclosure to end of data to the
									 * last element */
									if (bptr > limit) {
										/* if the line ends with enclosure, we need to go back by
										 * one character so the \0 character is not copied. */
										--bptr;
									}
									goto quit_loop_2;
								}
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 1284 but has the same functionality:
```c
if (csv_stream == NULL) {
									/* the enclosure is unterminated */
									if (bptr > limit) {
										/* if the line ends with enclosure, we need to go back by
										 * one character so the \0 character is not copied. */
										if (hunk_begin == bptr) {
											--hunk_begin;
										}
										--bptr;
									}
									goto quit_loop_2;
								}

								size_t new_len;
								char *new_buf = php_stream_get_line(csv_stream, NULL, 0, &new_len);
								if (!new_buf) {
									/* we've got an unterminated enclosure,
									 * assign all the data from the start of
									 * the enclosure to end of data to the
									 * last element */
									if (bptr > limit) {
										/* if the line ends with enclosure, we need to go back by
										 * one character so the \0 character is not copied. */
										if (hunk_begin == bptr) {
											--hunk_begin;
										}
										--bptr;
									}
									goto quit_loop_2;
								}
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
