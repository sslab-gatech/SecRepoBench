To prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer in this situation, ensure that the strings are stored in temporary pointers first and only write them to the destination buffer after confirming their validity. This approach allows for the detection of any invalid pointers before attempting to copy them, thereby avoiding potential NULL pointer dereferences.
