Ensure that any memory being accessed through pointers is still valid and has not been freed or reallocated elsewhere. In this context, consider implementing a mechanism to check the validity of the memory region before each usage, especially after operations that may alter memory allocations, to prevent dereferencing stale or dangling pointers.
