To prevent a buffer overflow in this code block, ensure that the index being accessed is adequately checked against the buffer length by using a more conservative boundary check, such as verifying the index plus the size of the data being accessed does not exceed the buffer's length. This approach avoids reading beyond the allocated memory, thereby preventing unintended memory access.
