Ensure that all strings copied using `ndpi_snprintf` are properly null-terminated and do not exceed the destination buffer's size, which can be done by checking the length of the source data before copying. Additionally, include necessary protocol checks to validate that the data is compatible with the expected protocol, preventing the reading of unallocated memory regions.
