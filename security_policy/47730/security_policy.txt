To prevent buffer overflow in this situation, ensure that the length of data copied into the buffer does not exceed the buffer's size by calculating the minimum of the data length and the buffer's capacity before copying. Additionally, always null-terminate the copied data to maintain proper string handling and prevent reading beyond the buffer's bounds.
