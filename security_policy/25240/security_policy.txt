To prevent writing data past the buffer's intended boundaries in this code block, ensure that `m_pModel->m_pCurrentMaterial` is checked for nullity before attempting to access or modify its fields. This prevents operations on a null pointer that could result in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Additionally, validate that `m_DataIt` does not exceed `m_DataItEnd` before dereferencing it, which ensures that you are not reading beyond the end of the buffer.
