Ensure that any index or length calculation involving buffer access is carefully checked to remain within valid bounds. Specifically, verify that the index used for accessing packet data does not exceed the allocated memory by checking that the position plus the offset does not surpass the packet's total length, thus preventing out-of-bounds access.
