To prevent the security issue, ensure that the control flow properly exits the function or loop using `break` instead of `return` when the specified condition is met, allowing for any necessary cleanup operations or memory management routines to be executed before returning control to the caller. This helps maintain the integrity of memory allocations and avoids unintended reuse of memory that might have been freed elsewhere in the program.
