When handling string assignments, ensure that memory is allocated anew by creating a fresh copy of the string data instead of directly assigning pointers to avoid double freeing issues. Specifically, use a function that duplicates or creates a new string object, managing its own memory, to prevent accidental reuse and deallocation of the same memory address.
