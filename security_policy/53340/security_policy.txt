Ensure that the index used to access any array or perform operations is validated against all relevant conditions, such as checking that `max_matrix_channel` is used consistently for comparison and correctly aligns with its intended constraints, rather than using `maxaudiochannel` mistakenly. This prevents scenarios where incorrect variables are used in conditional checks, ensuring that they do not inadvertently cause an invalid access by misusing the intended limits.
