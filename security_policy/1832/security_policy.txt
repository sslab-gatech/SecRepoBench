To ensure the array index is valid, check that `num_primitive_matrices` is within the allowed range before entering the loop, and if any condition fails, reset or sanitize the relevant array or variables to prevent using invalid data. Additionally, ensure that any failure condition exits gracefully without leaving any unprocessed or potentially harmful states.
