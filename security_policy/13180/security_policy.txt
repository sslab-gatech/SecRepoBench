Ensure that when accessing and using data that is allocated on the heap, particularly from external sources like file metadata, you carefully check and handle the size of the data before processing it. Specifically, validate and control the buffer size to prevent overwriting memory boundaries, such as by properly managing the buffer's extent with functions that safely limit string operations and by ensuring the associated data structures are correctly sized to avoid exceeding their allocated space.
