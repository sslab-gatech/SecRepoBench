Ensure that all pointers being set to NULL have their corresponding memory properly freed before doing so, to prevent any subsequent operations from accessing memory that may have been reallocated elsewhere. Additionally, maintain a clear and consistent protocol for managing memory allocations and deallocations, ensuring that any pointer being reused or reset reflects the current state of memory ownership.
