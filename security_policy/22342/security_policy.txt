Ensure that before accessing any elements of the `packet->payload` array, you verify that the `payload_packet_len` is sufficiently large to accommodate the access index, preventing any out-of-bounds reads or writes. Additionally, ensure that all necessary length checks are performed, particularly for conditional checks involving specific byte positions, to prevent potential buffer overflows when examining packet data.
