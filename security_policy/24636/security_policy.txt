Ensure that before initializing and skipping over the buffer with `bytestream2_init` and `bytestream2_skip`, you validate that the remaining bytes in the stream are sufficient to accommodate the intended operation size. This prevents accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer and avoids potential overflow situations.
