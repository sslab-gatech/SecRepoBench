To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this code block, ensure that the offsets and cursor operations do not exceed the boundaries of the allocated memory. Specifically, verify that any computed or derived offset values, such as `actuals_table_offset`, are within the valid range of the data structure and do not exceed the file size or available memory region. Additionally, check that pointer arithmetic results stay within the permissible range by adding boundary checks before using these pointers to access memory.
