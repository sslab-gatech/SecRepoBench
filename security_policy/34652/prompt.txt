The following code block contains CWE 122: A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

```c
      if (prec + e + 1 > buf_remaining) {
        prec = buf_remaining - e - 1;
      }

      if (originalformat == 'g') {
        prec += (e - 1);
      }
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 122 but has the same functionality:
```c
if (originalformat == 'g') {
        prec += (e - 1);
      }
      // truncate precision to prevent buffer overflow
      if (prec + 2 > buf_remaining) {
        prec = buf_remaining - 2;
      }
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
