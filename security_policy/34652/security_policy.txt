To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this situation, ensure that the precision value is adjusted to account for buffer limitations before any operations that increase its size. Specifically, after performing any modifications to the precision based on conditions, such as the format type, immediately check and truncate the precision to ensure it does not exceed the remaining buffer space, including any additional characters that will be appended.
