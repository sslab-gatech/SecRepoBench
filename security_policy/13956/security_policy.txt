To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure the base of the string table is checked against its limit before any pointer arithmetic, preventing potential out-of-bounds access. Additionally, validate that any calculated pointers, such as the entry index within the string table, do not exceed the string table boundaries before proceeding with further operations.
