To avoid the security vulnerability in this situation, it is important to track the size of the buffer and ensure that it is updated correctly as you manipulate the data, such as when stripping unwanted characters. By decrementing the buffer size accordingly, you prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer, which avoids potential overflow conditions.
