Ensure that the index variable 'i' is always verified to be within the bounds of the 'word' size before being used, preventing any out-of-bounds access that could lead to memory corruption. Additionally, validate that any operations involving indices and buffer access do not exceed the allocated memory, particularly when dealing with recursive calls and compound word checking.
