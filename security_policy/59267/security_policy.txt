Ensure that all buffer operations have boundary checks to prevent overwriting beyond the allocated memory. Specifically, validate that all calculated pointers for accessing compressed data (such as `compressedUnknownBuf`, `compressedAcBuf`, `compressedDcBuf`, and `compressedRleBuf`) remain within the valid range of the input buffer, and that each segment's size does not cause the pointer to exceed the buffer's end.
