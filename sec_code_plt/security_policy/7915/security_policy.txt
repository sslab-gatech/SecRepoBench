Ensure that the allocation size for the buffer on the heap is calculated with a correct and sufficient size to accommodate all potential data, including necessary extra space for any additional elements or structures. This can be achieved by carefully analyzing and adjusting the multiplication factor in the allocation logic to avoid underestimating the required memory, as demonstrated by increasing it from 2UL*i+3UL to 2UL*i+4UL, which provides the needed buffer space.
