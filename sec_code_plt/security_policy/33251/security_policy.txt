To prevent a buffer overflow in this scenario, ensure you check the buffer size against the expected minimum length before performing any operations that could extend beyond its bounds, like reading or writing data. Specifically, validate that the total length required to process the data, including any offsets and content size, does not exceed the allocated buffer size to ensure safe memory operations.
