To avoid writing outside of the buffer's bounds, ensure that the index pointer used to access elements within the buffer does not decrement to a negative value, especially when iterating backwards. Instead of allowing the index to reach zero, implement a safeguard to stop the iteration process when the index is greater than zero.
