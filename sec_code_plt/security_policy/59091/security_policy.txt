Ensure that any pointer arithmetic involving `line_ptr` checks that the pointer is still within bounds of the valid memory area by using proper comparison operators. Specifically, confirm that `line_ptr` is less than the boundary `line_ptr_end` before attempting to access or increment it, thus preventing any possibility of accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.
