To avoid the security vulnerability in this code block, ensure that when iterating over the payload to access or manipulate data, the loop increments are consistent with the size of the data being processed, such as iterating by 2 when handling 16-bit values. Additionally, verify that buffer sizes are sufficient and properly check against the total length of the payload to prevent out-of-bounds access.
