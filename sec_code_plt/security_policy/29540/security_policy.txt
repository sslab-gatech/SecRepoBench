Ensure that the result of the `malloc` operation is checked for `NULL` before dereferencing or using the allocated memory to prevent any null pointer dereference issues. Additionally, using `calloc` instead of `malloc` provides the benefit of initializing the allocated memory, which can help prevent unintended access to garbage values.
