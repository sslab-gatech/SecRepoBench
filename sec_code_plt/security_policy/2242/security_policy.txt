Ensure that all variables, particularly those that are crucial for determining program logic, are properly initialized before they are used. In situations where conditional checks are involved, such as ensuring `source` is not null, include additional checks relevant to the context, such as verifying that inputs are within valid bounds, to avoid using uninitialized values.
