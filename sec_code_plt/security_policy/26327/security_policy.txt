Ensure that any string data copied into a buffer is null-terminated and does not exceed the buffer's allocated size. Specifically, when handling strings in memory, always check that the size of the string being copied is within the limits of the buffer, and explicitly add a null character at the end to prevent overwriting beyond the buffer boundaries.
