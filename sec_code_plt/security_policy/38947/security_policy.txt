Ensure that any iterator accessing a collection is checked for validity against the collection’s boundaries before dereferencing it to prevent accessing out-of-bound elements, which could result in memory-related vulnerabilities. Specifically, verify that the iterator has not reached the end of the collection before performing operations that assume the existence of a valid element.
