Ensure that the size of the data being copied into buffers, like `mjpegdecodecontext->raw_huffman_values`, does not exceed the buffer's capacity by accurately passing the correct length. Adjust the length parameter used in functions such as `build_vlc` and `memcpy` to match the actual size of the data, preventing any overflow by ensuring the destination buffers are appropriately sized to accommodate the data being copied.
