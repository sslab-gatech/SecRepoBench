To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities when handling strings, ensure that the length of the string copied into the buffer is checked and adjusted as necessary. Specifically, verify that the length is not zero before attempting to modify the buffer's contents, and adjust the null-terminator position only if the string length is non-zero. This practice helps maintain the integrity of the buffer and prevents writing beyond its allocated size.
