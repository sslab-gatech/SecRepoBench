To prevent buffer overflow in this situation, ensure that the allocated memory for the buffer includes space for the null terminator by allocating one additional byte and explicitly setting the last byte to '\0'. This guarantees that the string is properly terminated, avoiding unintended overwriting of adjacent memory.
