To prevent potential heap overflow, ensure that the source pointer's position is validated against the source buffer's boundaries before performing operations like reading compressed sizes or compressed bytes. Additionally, update and track the remaining size of the source buffer to ensure that each operation does not exceed the available data, preventing buffer overflow by ensuring that operations only proceed when there is sufficient data left to process.
