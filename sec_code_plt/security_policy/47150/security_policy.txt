Ensure that you check for the presence of expected characters in the input string before accessing them, verifying that the input is not an empty string and that it contains at least two characters to safely perform operations on specific indexes. This precaution helps prevent accessing memory out of the input string's bounds, mitigating the risk of buffer overflow.
