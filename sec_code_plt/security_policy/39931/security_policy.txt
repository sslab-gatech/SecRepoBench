Ensure that the stack is extended by considering both the base offset and the number of additional arguments, as this prevents buffer overflows by properly accommodating all required elements. Adjust the parameters of the `mrb_stack_extend` function to account for the base index `n` alongside the argument count, ensuring sufficient space is allocated for the operation.
