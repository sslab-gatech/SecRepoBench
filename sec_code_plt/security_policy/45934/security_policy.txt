To avoid the security vulnerability when writing this code block, ensure that the memory referenced by a pointer is not accessed after it has been freed or when it may contain invalid data. Specifically, implement checks to confirm the validity of the data before performing operations, such as verifying if an identifier is correctly initialized or if a value is within expected bounds, thereby preventing improper access to potentially reused memory.
