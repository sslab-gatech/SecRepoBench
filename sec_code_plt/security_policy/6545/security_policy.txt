Ensure that the memory allocation for the buffer accounts for the maximum possible number of elements and any additional overhead that might be required for complex operations, such as those involving Bezier curves or other geometric calculations. Additionally, always verify that the allocated memory size is sufficient to store all data elements before performing operations that could exceed the buffer's boundaries.
