To avoid the risk of accessing invalid memory, ensure that any memory referenced by a pointer is not reused after being freed or reassigned. Specifically, maintain a valid reference to any essential data, such as a document structure, by setting the necessary fields immediately after reallocating or reassigning memory to preserve its integrity and intended structure.
