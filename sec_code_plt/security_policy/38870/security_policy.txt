Ensure that the size of the filename being processed does not exceed the allocated buffer length by checking that `fileInfo.size_filename` is less than or equal to `max_filename_length` before using it to construct the string. This precaution helps prevent buffer overflows by ensuring that the data fits within the designated storage space.
