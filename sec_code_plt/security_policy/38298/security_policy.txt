Ensure that when calculating the `tail`, it does not exceed the allocated `arraylength` by adjusting `len` appropriately, preventing buffer overflows. Additionally, always verify that any index used for accessing the array falls within the bounds of the allocated memory, raising an error for out-of-range indices to maintain safe access.
