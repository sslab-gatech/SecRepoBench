To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that any memory allocated is properly managed by avoiding the reuse of pointers to freed memory. Specifically, before freeing any memory, make sure that all pointers referencing that memory are either set to NULL or updated to point to valid memory locations. Additionally, consistently check that memory allocations are successful before using them, and ensure that once memory is freed, the pointer is no longer used in subsequent operations.
