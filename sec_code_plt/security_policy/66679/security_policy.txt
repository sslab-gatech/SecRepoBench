To avoid referencing memory after it has been freed, ensure that pointers to memory locations are set to NULL immediately after freeing the memory, and verify that any operation involving these pointers checks that they are non-NULL before proceeding. This will prevent unintended access to memory that may have been reallocated elsewhere in the program.
