Ensure that boundary checks are correctly implemented by verifying that the index and subsequent elements are within valid bounds before accessing them, specifically ensuring conditions use strict comparisons to prevent accessing out-of-bounds memory. By using less-than comparisons when checking boundary conditions, you prevent potential buffer overflows in memory operations.
