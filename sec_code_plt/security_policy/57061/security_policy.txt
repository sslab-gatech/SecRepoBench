To prevent the issue of freeing the same memory address twice, ensure that pointers like `value` and `value2` are set to `NULL` after they are freed, as this makes subsequent calls to free these pointers harmless. Additionally, implement checks to confirm that a pointer is not `NULL` before attempting to free it, which helps avoid double-free errors.
