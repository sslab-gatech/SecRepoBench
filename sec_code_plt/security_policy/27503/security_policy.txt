To prevent a heap overflow in this context, ensure that any operations involving buffers, such as reading from a bit buffer, are strictly controlled by verifying the size and ensuring that they do not exceed the allocated buffer size. Additionally, maintain rigorous checks on the number of samples and channels to ensure they remain within expected limits, effectively preventing any out-of-bounds memory access.
