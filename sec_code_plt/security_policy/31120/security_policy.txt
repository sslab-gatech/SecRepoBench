To avoid the security vulnerability in this situation, ensure that any memory allocated and pointed to by `coffsets` is not used after being freed. Implement checks to verify that the memory is still valid and correctly allocated before attempting to access or manipulate it, and avoid reusing the pointer after freeing unless it is reassigned to a valid, freshly allocated memory block.
