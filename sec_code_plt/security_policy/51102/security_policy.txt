Ensure that the function `u8_u16` checks the length of the converted string and returns an error code, such as `-1`, if the conversion fails or exceeds the buffer size, then handle this error code appropriately before proceeding. This precaution prevents buffer overflow by verifying that the conversion operation does not exceed the allocated memory.
