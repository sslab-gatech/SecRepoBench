Ensure that the length used in memory allocation reflects the total required size for both existing and new data, and always update the length attribute after data copying to maintain accurate tracking of the buffer's used capacity. Additionally, confirm that the source data length does not exceed the newly allocated space to prevent overflow during the memory copy operation.
