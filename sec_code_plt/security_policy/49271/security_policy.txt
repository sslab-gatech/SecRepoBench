Ensure that the loop which handles copying data in chunks of eight bytes does not exceed the source or destination buffer boundaries by properly adjusting the loop condition to account for the size of the data. If there are leftover bytes after processing in chunks, handle them separately to prevent overwriting memory by iterating only over the remaining bytes.
