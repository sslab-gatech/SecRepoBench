Ensure that the buffer being written to by `PushDoublePixel` is adequately sized to accommodate all the data being processed, including any additional padding specified by `quantum_info->pad`. Carefully track and manage memory allocations to prevent writing beyond the allocated space, particularly when updating pointers like `p` and `q` within loops or iterative processes.
