When comparing non-null-terminated strings, use functions that respect the specified length to prevent overrunning the allocated memory, as using `strncmp` instead of `memcmp` can help ensure a safer comparison by treating the input as character strings. This approach prevents overwriting memory by ensuring the buffer does not exceed its bounds during string comparison operations.
