Ensure that the loop iterates only up to the second last element in the array by adjusting the loop's termination condition, thereby preventing access beyond the allocated memory bounds. Additionally, verify that the input value comparisons and index accesses are within valid bounds to avoid overrunning the allocated heap memory.
