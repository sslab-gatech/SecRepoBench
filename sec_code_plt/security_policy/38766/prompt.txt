The following code block contains CWE 125: The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

```c
/* Read magic1,magic2,lzma_params from the ZIPX stream. */
	if((lzma_stream_pointer = __archive_read_ahead(a, 9, NULL)) == NULL) {
		archive_set_error(&a->archive, ARCHIVE_ERRNO_FILE_FORMAT,
		    "Truncated lzma data");
		return (ARCHIVE_FATAL);
	}

	if(lzma_stream_pointer[2] != 0x05 || lzma_stream_pointer[3] != 0x00) {
		archive_set_error(&a->archive, ARCHIVE_ERRNO_FILE_FORMAT,
		    "Invalid lzma data");
		return (ARCHIVE_FATAL);
	}

	/* Prepare an lzma alone header: copy the lzma_params blob into
	 * a proper place into the lzma alone header. */
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 125 but has the same functionality:
```c
/* Read magic1,magic2,lzma_params from the ZIPX stream. */
	if(zip->entry_bytes_remaining < 9 || (lzma_stream_pointer = __archive_read_ahead(a, 9, NULL)) == NULL) {
		archive_set_error(&a->archive, ARCHIVE_ERRNO_FILE_FORMAT,
		    "Truncated lzma data");
		return (ARCHIVE_FATAL);
	}

	if(lzma_stream_pointer[2] != 0x05 || lzma_stream_pointer[3] != 0x00) {
		archive_set_error(&a->archive, ARCHIVE_ERRNO_FILE_FORMAT,
		    "Invalid lzma data");
		return (ARCHIVE_FATAL);
	}

	/* Prepare an lzma alone header: copy the lzma_params blob into
	 * a proper place into the lzma alone header. */
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
