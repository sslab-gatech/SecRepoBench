To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that before accessing or copying data from a buffer, you consistently verify that the operation does not exceed the allocated buffer size. Specifically, maintain an accurate length of the payload being processed and check that any calculated offsets plus the size of data being accessed do not surpass this length, thereby preventing buffer overflows.
