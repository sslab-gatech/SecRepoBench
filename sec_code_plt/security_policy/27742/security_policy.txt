To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that the type and structure of the parsed objects are thoroughly validated before performing operations on them. This involves checking that the object is indeed an array and that its elements are of the expected types, such as verifying that a map is actually present before accessing its size, which helps prevent dereferencing invalid or freed pointers.
