Ensure that any changes made to pointers, such as updating attributes, are conditional based on the current state of the program, such as the streaming mode, to prevent improper memory access. This approach helps maintain the integrity of memory management by ensuring that pointers are only modified when it's safe to do so, thereby avoiding operations on potentially freed or reallocated memory.
