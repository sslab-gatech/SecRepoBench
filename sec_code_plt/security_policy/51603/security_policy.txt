Ensure that any operations involving pointers and buffers check for boundary conditions, especially when incrementing pointers or processing input. Specifically, verify that any string or buffer operations respect their defined limits, and preemptively handle cases where operations could exceed these limits, thereby preventing any potential overflow scenarios.
