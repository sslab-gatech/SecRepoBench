To prevent buffer overflow in this context, ensure that the buffer `buf` has sufficient size to accommodate all potential data, including edge cases, by checking that pointers like `n` do not exceed the buffer's bounds while copying data. Additionally, include conditions to safely handle situations where the buffer might become full by implementing logic to truncate input or return a safe value before any overflow occurs.
