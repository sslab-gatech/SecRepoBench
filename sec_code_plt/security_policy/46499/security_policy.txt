To avoid the risk of overwriting the buffer when processing packet payload data, ensure that every access to the payload checks that the index is within the bounds of the payload's length. This can be achieved by verifying that the index remains less than the total payload length before accessing or incrementing it, thus preventing buffer overflows by ensuring each operation is within the allocated memory limits.
