Ensure that any memory or resources allocated for `mng_info` are properly freed only when they are no longer needed, and avoid using a reference to `mng_info` after it has been released. In particular, do not attempt to access or modify `mng_info` after the conditional block that frees it, especially when handling exceptions or errors.
