Ensure that the length of the filename, particularly when subtracting for null terminators or other delimiters, does not become negative or allow for inadequate buffer allocation, as this could lead to writing beyond the allocated memory. Specifically, include checks to verify that the calculated length for memory allocation is not less than the minimum required size to accommodate the string and its null terminator, thereby preventing unintended memory access.
