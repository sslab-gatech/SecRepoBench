Ensure that you check whether the length used to index the buffer actually falls within the valid range of the string, such as by verifying that the character accessed is not the null terminator, to prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer. This preemptive check helps in avoiding reading past the end of the string, which can lead to buffer overflow issues.
