To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that any references to the memory being freed, such as those in any child or related structures, are properly removed or invalidated before the memory is released. Additionally, thoroughly check and maintain the integrity of data structures that may still hold references to the freed memory, ensuring they do not attempt to access or modify it after deallocation.
