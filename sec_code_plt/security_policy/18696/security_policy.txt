To prevent buffer overflows when dynamically allocating memory, ensure to always allocate additional space by including a predefined padding value. This preemptively accounts for any extra space that might be needed, thereby preventing allocations that are too small and could lead to overwriting adjacent memory. Additionally, check for successful memory allocation after each attempt to resize, and handle any failures gracefully by freeing already allocated resources.
