To prevent buffer overflow in this scenario, ensure that the length of the string being processed (`cname_str`) is verified to be within the bounds of the buffer it is meant to fit into before any operations are performed on it. Specifically, confirm that the length does not exceed the size of the buffer to prevent overwriting memory outside its allocated space.
