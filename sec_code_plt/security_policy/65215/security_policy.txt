Ensure that the length of the `urlString` is sufficient before performing operations that involve accessing specific indices or moving memory, thereby preventing any out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, always check that the positions accessed within the string are within the valid range of the string's length to prevent unintended overwrites or access to memory not allocated for the string.
