Ensure that when implementing methods to interact with buffers, such as reading or seeking operations, you include checks to confirm the position and size of the buffer are within valid bounds before accessing it. This involves validating that any indices used for accessing the buffer do not exceed its allocated memory limits, preventing out-of-bounds reads or writes.
