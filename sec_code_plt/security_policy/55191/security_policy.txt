To prevent the security vulnerability in this code block, ensure that any access to elements of the `word` array is preceded by a boundary check to confirm that the index is within the valid range of the array. Specifically, always verify that `char_index` and any derived indices are less than the size of the `word` array to prevent reading or writing beyond its bounds.
