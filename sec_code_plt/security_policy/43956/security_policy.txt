To prevent writing past the end of the buffer in this context, ensure that any index used to access elements in the buffer is checked against the buffer's size before use. Additionally, incorporate error handling to catch and respond to situations where necessary conditions, such as required arguments, are not met, thereby preventing operations that could inadvertently extend beyond the buffer's boundaries.
