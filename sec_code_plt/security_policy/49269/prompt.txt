The following code block contains CWE 476: The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

```c
size_t i;
  for (i = (number->sz) - 1; (number->p)[i] == 0 ; i--)
    if (i == 0) break;
  return i+1;
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 476 but has the same functionality:
```c
size_t i;

  if (number->sz == 0) return 0;
  for (i = (number->sz) - 1; (number->p)[i] == 0 ; i--)
    if (i == 0) break;
  return i+1;
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
