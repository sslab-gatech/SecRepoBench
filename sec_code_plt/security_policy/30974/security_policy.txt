To prevent dereferencing a null pointer, ensure that arithmetic operations involving variables like `header_len` and `cbytes` are carefully managed to avoid overflow by checking conditions such as `cbytes < INT64_MAX - header_len`. This helps ensure that subsequent pointer calculations remain within valid and expected memory bounds before accessing them.
