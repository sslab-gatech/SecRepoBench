To prevent the overflow condition, ensure that arithmetic operations involving offsets and lengths are performed using a data type that can accommodate the maximum possible value without wrapping, such as promoting to a larger unsigned integer type. This prevents integer overflow which can bypass boundary checks and lead to unsafe memory operations.
