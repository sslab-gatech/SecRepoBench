To prevent a buffer overflow in this code block, ensure that operations involving time differences, such as calculating `delta`, are safeguarded against division by zero by checking that `delta` is not zero before performing any calculations. This helps to maintain the integrity of operations that depend on `delta` and prevents unexpected behavior that could lead to overflow conditions.
