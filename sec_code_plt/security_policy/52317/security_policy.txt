To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that any operation using a substring from a string, such as when calculating syllable numbers, includes a boundary check to confirm the index is within the valid range of the string's size before attempting to access it. This precaution prevents potential out-of-bounds access, which could lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
