Ensure that when comparing the payload length with the computed size, you perform the comparison using a data type that can accommodate the largest possible values, such as a 64-bit integer, to prevent integer overflow. This approach guarantees that the comparison accurately reflects the actual buffer size, thus preventing potential overflow conditions.
