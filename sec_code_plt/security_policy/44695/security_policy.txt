Ensure that all pointer arithmetic and comparisons involving `endp`, `fendp`, and `str_end` are correctly handled to prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, make sure that conditions checking the bounds are accurately implemented to avoid dereferencing pointers that could lead to writing or reading outside the intended buffer area, which helps prevent buffer overflows in heap memory.
