Ensure that the pointer `p` is checked to confirm it points within the bounds of `primitive` before performing operations that manipulate strings, thereby preventing buffer overflows by avoiding out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, always verify that the memory allocated for buffers is sufficient to accommodate all concatenated strings and terminators, especially after dynamic operations like concatenation.
