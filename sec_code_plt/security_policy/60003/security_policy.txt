Ensure that any access to elements of the packet payload is preceded by a check that verifies the payload length is sufficient to include the accessed elements, preventing out-of-bounds access and potential overflow situations. For instance, before accessing specific payload indices, confirm that the payload length is greater than the maximum index you intend to access.
