To prevent errors associated with deallocating memory, ensure that any pointer passed to a deallocation function is actually pointing to memory that was allocated using the corresponding heap allocation functions. In this context, avoid calling custom deallocation functions on objects or memory that were never allocated with the associated allocation functions, such as avoiding `_free_compiled_subset_glyphs` on objects managed by containers unless they were specifically allocated in a compatible manner.
