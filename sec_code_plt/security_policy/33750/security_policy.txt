To prevent memory management issues, ensure that any pointer that has been freed is immediately set to NULL, as this will prevent accidental re-use of the same pointer. Additionally, double-check that each call to free() is only made on pointers that have not already been deallocated, thus avoiding unintended operations on already freed memory.
