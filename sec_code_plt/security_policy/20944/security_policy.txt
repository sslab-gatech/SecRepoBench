Ensure that the calculated `num_glyphs` value does not exceed the actual number of glyphs available in the font by using a limiting function like `hb_min`. This prevents potential overflow issues by constraining the value within safe and expected bounds, thereby mitigating the risk of buffer overflow on the heap.
