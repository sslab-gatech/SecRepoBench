To prevent the issue of referencing freed memory, ensure that any pointer manipulation or updates are correctly conditioned to avoid acting upon pointers that may have been invalidated, such as checking for conditions where the current and previous pointers might overlap due to memory reuse. Specifically, confirm that the insertion logic is appropriately guarded to handle scenarios where the pointers have not been unintentionally coalesced, ensuring the integrity of the data structure.
