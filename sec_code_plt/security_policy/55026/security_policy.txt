To avoid memory-related vulnerabilities, ensure that any adjustments to buffer size, such as those based on codec-specific requirements, properly account for the maximum expected dimensions, and validate alignment values before using them to allocate memory on the heap. Implement boundary checks when calculating buffer sizes to ensure they remain within safe limits based on the specific format and codec being handled.
