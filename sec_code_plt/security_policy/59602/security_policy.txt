Ensure to check that the pointer `loc_ptr` does not exceed or equal `section_end` before accessing or modifying it to prevent accessing memory outside the allocated buffer. Additionally, after any pointer arithmetic, validate that `loc_ptr` remains within the bounds of `section_end` to avoid overrunning the allocated memory region.
