Ensure that the parsing loop correctly checks for the null terminator after extracting a subexpression and before incrementing the pointer `p` to prevent overrunning the allocated buffer. Always validate that the destination buffer, `subexpression`, has adequate space to accommodate the incoming data, thereby preventing any potential overflow during the copying process.
