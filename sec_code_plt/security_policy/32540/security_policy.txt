To avoid the vulnerability, ensure that any buffer or collection access is accompanied by a check to determine whether the item exists and has adequate capacity before performing operations like clearing or setting values. Specifically, only clear the buffer or set once you have confirmed that it has been properly initialized and is not null, preventing any unintended writes beyond its boundaries.
