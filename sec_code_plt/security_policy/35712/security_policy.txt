To prevent buffer overflow issues in this context, ensure that the program counter (`pc`) is saved in a safe location before any potential jumps or changes in execution flow occur. This can be done by consistently updating a control structure's program counter field with the current `pc` value before executing potentially unsafe instructions or operations. This practice helps maintain the program's correct state and prevents overwriting unintended memory areas.
