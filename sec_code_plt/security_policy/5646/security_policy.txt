Ensure that any string operations, such as comparisons or copying, take into account the actual length and boundaries of the buffer to prevent overwriting beyond its allocated size. Specifically, verify that the index used for string manipulation does not exceed the buffer size, and adjust length checks to account for any potential edge cases where offsets are introduced.
