To prevent the overflow condition, ensure that any access to the buffer is preceded by a check that verifies the index is within the buffer's capacity. Specifically, when accessing elements of a buffer, use conditional checks to confirm that the index is within bounds, and handle cases where it is not, such as by setting a default value or taking corrective action.
