To avoid inadvertently freeing the same memory address twice, ensure that any memory deallocation occurs under strictly controlled conditions where the state and ownership of the memory are clear and managed. Additionally, introduce checks or conditions to verify that an invalid or unexpected flag value does not result in improper memory management, such as reusing or incorrectly freeing memory.
