The following code block contains CWE 122: A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

```c
int status;
    int footer_start;
    uint8_t *pb;
    size_t out_size;
    void *out_buf;
    z_stream strm;
    mz_ulong crc;


    /*
     * GZIP relies on an algorithm with worst-case expansion
     * of 5 bytes per 32KB data. This means we need to create a variable
     * length output, that depends on the input length.
     * See RFC 1951 for details.
     */
    int max_input_expansion = ((int)(input_size / 32000) + 1) * 5;

    /*
     * Max compressed size is equal to sum of:
     *   10 byte header
     *   8 byte foot
     *   max input expansion
     *   size of input
     */
    out_size = 10 + 8 + max_input_expansion + input_size;
    out_buf = flb_malloc(out_size);
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 122 but has the same functionality:
```c
int status;
    int footer_start;
    uint8_t *pb;
    size_t out_size;
    void *out_buf;
    z_stream strm;
    mz_ulong crc;

    /*
     * Calculating the upper bound for a gzip compression is
     * non-trivial, so we rely on miniz's own calculation
     * to guarantee memory safety.
     */
    out_size = compressBound(input_size);
    out_buf = flb_malloc(out_size);
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
