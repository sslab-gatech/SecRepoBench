To prevent accessing data outside the intended buffer, ensure that the total size of the record does not exceed the allocated data length by checking that the combined pointer of the record's base and its size does not surpass the buffer's boundary. Additionally, confirm that there are records present and that their total size is non-zero before proceeding with operations, assigning a null value if these conditions are not met to indicate an invalid record state.
