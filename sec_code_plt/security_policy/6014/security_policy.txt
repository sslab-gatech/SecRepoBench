To prevent a buffer overflow in this code block, ensure that the loop checks for a null terminator after the inner `while` loop before continuing, as this ensures the loop exits gracefully when the end of the string is reached. This prevents attempting to process beyond the string's allocated memory, maintaining the buffer's integrity.
