Ensure that both setIndex and nField are validated to confirm they are within the valid range of indices by checking they are not negative and not exceeding their respective upper limits, nPatches and nSamples. This prevents accessing memory outside the intended buffer by verifying that indices are within the valid bounds before proceeding with any data operations.
