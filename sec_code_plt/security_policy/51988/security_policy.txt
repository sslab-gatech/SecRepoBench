To avoid the security vulnerability in this situation, ensure that pointer operations do not exceed the bounds of the data they reference, specifically by including boundary checks to prevent the pointer from moving past the start of the buffer during iterations. This can be achieved by verifying that the pointer remains greater than the initial buffer address before dereferencing or decrementing it.
