Ensure that any boundary manipulation involving pointers, such as decrementing a pointer, is accompanied by a check to ensure it remains within valid limits and does not cause an underflow. In scenarios where multiple pointers are adjusted, verify all related pointers are appropriately checked to maintain consistency and avoid accessing unintended memory locations.
