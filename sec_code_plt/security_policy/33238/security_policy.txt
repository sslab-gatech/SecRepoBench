To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this code, ensure that string operations, such as comparing and erasing, are performed only when there is a sufficient number of characters remaining in the string. Specifically, always verify that there are enough characters left before using functions like `strncmp` to avoid reading beyond the string's boundaries.
