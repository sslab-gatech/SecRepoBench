Ensure that the conditions for boundary checks cover all relevant dimensions by adjusting the comparison limits to include the chroma height shift. This adjustment prevents any out-of-bounds memory access by ensuring that calculations involving `sourcex`, `uvsrc_y`, and `src_y` are always within the permissible memory range before using them as indices.
