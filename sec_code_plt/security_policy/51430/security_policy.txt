To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities when manipulating strings, use high-level operations that manage buffer sizes internally, such as `std::string` methods like `compare`, instead of manually using lower-level functions like `strncmp`, which require explicit length management. This approach minimizes the risk of exceeding buffer boundaries by leveraging the inherent safety of `std::string` operations that automatically handle string sizes.
