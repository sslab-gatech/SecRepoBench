Ensure that the check for available packet length accounts for all header sizes, including both the UDP and VXLAN headers, before proceeding with packet processing. This prevents processing beyond the buffer limits by verifying that the packet size is sufficient to accommodate both headers, thus avoiding potential overflows.
