To avoid the risk of buffer overflow in this code block, ensure the buffer size is sufficiently large to accommodate all potential data, including the maximum possible width and any additional characters like signs. Always validate and confirm that the calculated size (`need`) does not exceed the buffer's capacity before performing operations that write to it.
