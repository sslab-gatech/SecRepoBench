To prevent the security vulnerability in this code block, ensure that the packet size is sufficient by checking that the total offset does not exceed the captured packet length before processing any packet data. This involves validating that the header's captured length is at least the combined size of the initial offset, IP length, and UDP header, along with any additional bytes expected for processing.
