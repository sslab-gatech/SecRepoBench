To prevent a buffer overflow when working with the payload, ensure that the buffer size is checked to be at least as large as the expected data length before performing operations like `memcmp`. In this context, verify that `payload_len` is at least 7 before comparing the first 7 bytes with a string to avoid reading beyond the buffer's allocated memory.
