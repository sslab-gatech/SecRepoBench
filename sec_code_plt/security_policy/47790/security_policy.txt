Ensure that the loop terminates before attempting to access memory beyond the allocated buffer by checking if the starting index exceeds the limit, such as `glyph_count`, before the loop begins. This prevents any operations from occurring if the initial condition indicates an overflow risk, thereby maintaining safe bounds for memory operations.
