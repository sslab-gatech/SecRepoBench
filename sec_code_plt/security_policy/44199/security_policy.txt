Ensure that you encapsulate token information within a structured context, such as a struct, which includes both the token array and the count of tokens, to prevent inadvertently accessing out-of-bounds memory. This structured approach provides a safeguard by allowing functions to receive both the tokens and their limits, minimizing the risk of writing beyond allocated memory.
