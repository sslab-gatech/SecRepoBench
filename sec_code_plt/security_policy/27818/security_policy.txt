To prevent the security vulnerability in this code block, ensure that the pointer arithmetic is carefully checked against buffer boundaries before reading additional bytes, especially when the length value indicates that multiple bytes will be accessed. Use boundary checks to verify that the pointer does not exceed the valid memory region before any increment operations, thereby avoiding potential overflows.
