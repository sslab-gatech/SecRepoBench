To prevent the risk of a buffer overflow when working with the payload, ensure that the loop condition accounts for the additional bytes that will be accessed, such as when calling a function like `get16` that reads more than one byte. This can be done by checking that the offset plus the required number of bytes does not exceed the buffer's total length.
