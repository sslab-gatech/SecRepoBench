To prevent potential buffer overflow issues, ensure that any access to the payload accounts for its size by validating that the offset plus the size of the data being accessed does not exceed the total payload length. This check must be done before dereferencing pointers or performing operations that assume the presence of certain data beyond the current position in the payload.
