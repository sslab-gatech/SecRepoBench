Ensure that before appending any string to the buffer, you accurately calculate the total required space by considering both the prefix and name length, along with any additional formatting characters, and verify that the buffer has enough capacity to accommodate this length. This proactive check helps prevent exceeding the buffer's capacity, thereby avoiding overflow issues.
