To avoid the security vulnerability, ensure that any operation involving conversion or manipulation of large data types, such as big integers, includes proper checks and constraints to prevent memory overflow. Particularly, when dealing with different types of inputs, ensure adequate validation and safe handling mechanisms are in place to prevent writing beyond allocated memory boundaries in the heap.
