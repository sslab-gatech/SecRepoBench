To prevent buffer overflow when managing profiles, store them in a dynamically resizable data structure like a linked list instead of relying on static buffers. Ensure that any data being read into a buffer is validated to confirm it does not exceed the allocated capacity, and dynamically expand storage as needed to accommodate the data safely.
