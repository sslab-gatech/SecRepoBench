To prevent heap overflow vulnerabilities, ensure that the allocated memory size accurately reflects the data requirements by conditionally adjusting for data type sizes using compile-time checks or macros. Additionally, use validation checks to confirm that calculations for buffer size do not result in smaller or improperly aligned allocations due to platform-specific differences.
