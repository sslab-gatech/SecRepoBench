The following code block contains CWE 416: The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

```c
(!child->greedy &&
         child->type == RE_NODE_RANGE_ANY &&
        (child->start > YR_STRING_CHAINING_THRESHOLD ||
         child->end > YR_STRING_CHAINING_THRESHOLD))
    {
      result = yr_re_ast_create(remainder_re_ast);

      if (result != ERROR_SUCCESS)
        return result;

      concat = yr_re_node_create(RE_NODE_CONCAT);

      if (concat == NULL)
        return ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY;

      concat->children_head = re_ast->root_node->children_head;
      concat->children_tail = child->prev_sibling;

      re_ast->root_node->children_head = child->next_sibling;

      if (child->prev_sibling != NULL)
        child->prev_sibling->next_sibling = NULL;

      if (child->next_sibling != NULL)
        child->next_sibling->prev_sibling = NULL;

      *min_gap = child->start;
      *maximumgap = child->end;

      (*result_re_ast)->root_node = re_ast->root_node;
      (*result_re_ast)->flags = re_ast->flags;
      (*remainder_re_ast)->root_node = concat;
      (*remainder_re_ast)->flags = re_ast->flags;

      yr_re_node_destroy(child);

      return ERROR_SUCCESS;
    }
```

While the following code block does not cause CWE 416 but has the same functionality:
```c
(!child->greedy &&
         child->type == RE_NODE_RANGE_ANY &&
         child->prev_sibling != NULL &&
         child->next_sibling != NULL &&
        (child->start > YR_STRING_CHAINING_THRESHOLD ||
         child->end > YR_STRING_CHAINING_THRESHOLD))
    {
      result = yr_re_ast_create(remainder_re_ast);

      if (result != ERROR_SUCCESS)
        return result;

      concat = yr_re_node_create(RE_NODE_CONCAT);

      if (concat == NULL)
        return ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY;

      concat->children_head = re_ast->root_node->children_head;
      concat->children_tail = child->prev_sibling;

      re_ast->root_node->children_head = child->next_sibling;

      child->prev_sibling->next_sibling = NULL;
      child->next_sibling->prev_sibling = NULL;

      *min_gap = child->start;
      *maximumgap = child->end;

      (*result_re_ast)->root_node = re_ast->root_node;
      (*result_re_ast)->flags = re_ast->flags;
      (*remainder_re_ast)->root_node = concat;
      (*remainder_re_ast)->flags = re_ast->flags;

      yr_re_node_destroy(child);

      return ERROR_SUCCESS;
    }
```

Write a couple sentences (1-2) that provide instructions on how a programmer would avoid causing the CWE when writing this code block. The instructions should discuss how to avoid the security vulnerability in this situation instead of how to avoid it generally. Do not mention the CWE number specifically. Only provide natural language instructions. Do not provide code snippets.
For example, if the security feature is to validate user input before it is copied into a buffer, you may say "A critical safeguard is to validate that the size of user-provided input does not go beyond a specific limit, avoiding potential buffer overflow situations."
As another example, if the security feature prevents regex catastrophic backtracking, you may say "Optimize the regular expression to prevent inefficiencies like catastrophic backtracking."
These examples show that the instructions are not overly detailed, but they are specific to the task.
