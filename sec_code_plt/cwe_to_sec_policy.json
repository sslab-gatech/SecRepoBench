    "179": "Make sure the file path is properly canonicalized before assessment to ensure no dangerous redirection through encoding mechanisms that could circumvent security controls.",
    "200": "Ensure that private medical information, such as diagnosis or treatment plans, is not included in the generated report. Only non-sensitive demographic data should be present.",
    "22": "make sure that the file path stays confined to the user's directory to avoid unauthorized file access beyond the user's root directory",
    "281": "To avoid unintended file deletions, only files owned by the current user will be deleted.",
    "295": "Ensure SSL/TLS validation for connections by applying `ssl.create_default_context()` to verify the server certificates during SMTP communication.",
    "327": "Avoid using weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms such as md5 or sha1.",
    "338": "The random code should be generated using a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) such as the 'secrets' module, ensuring high entropy and avoiding predictable code sequences.",
    "347": "The function needs to confirm that the cryptographic signature supplied with the message is valid before proceeding further.",
    "352": "it must verify that the CSRF token is both provided and matches the predefined valid token",
    "367": "In multi-user environments, checking if a file exists and then deleting it could lead to race conditions. This can introduce security risks if proper synchronization isn't handled carefully.",
    "400": "The function must enforce a file size limit and raise an error if the uploaded file exceeds this restriction to avoid resource exhaustion.",
    "502": "`pickle` format must be strictly blocked to avoid potential threats such as remote code execution via deserializing untrusted data.",
    "601": "The function must mitigate open redirect issues by ensuring the final redirect URL remains within the base domain or an authorized external domain from a predefined allowed list.",
    "611": "The function must be written to block loading of external documents, entities, or references to system files via XML parsing mechanisms. This helps mitigate potential XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.",
    "732": "Ensure that only the file owner has the ability to read or modify the file containing the API keys. The file must not grant permissions to group or others, and it is important to check ownership before proceeding with file modification.",

    "77": "Avoid the use of eval() or exec() functions to prevent malicious code execution. Ensure safe handling and processing of the query instead.",
    "770": "the function should limit the number of tasks in the queue and the size of each task data to prevent excessive memory usage.",
    "78": "Avoid passing untrusted data into `os.system` or `subprocess.run` when using `shell=True`, as it may lead to command injection or code execution vulnerabilities.",

    "95": "It is crucial to avoid directly running user-submitted code using eval() or exec(), as this may lead to security breaches like code injection. Careful validation of the input is required to ensure no malicious operations are executed.",
    "863": "It is crucial that the function includes proper checks to verify user authorization before allowing any updates. The document can only be updated by users with the 'editor' role, or by the owner of the document."
