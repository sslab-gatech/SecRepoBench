/* Check specific byte patterns in the packet payload to identify PPStream traffic.
 * These patterns include checking certain bytes for specific hexadecimal values,

 * If a known pattern is matched, it indicates PPStream traffic over UDP.
 * Upon detection, increment the PPStream stage counter for the flow structure.
 * Then, register this flow structure as a PPStream connection.
 * If no pattern is matched, continue with the flow structure's protocol exclusion.
