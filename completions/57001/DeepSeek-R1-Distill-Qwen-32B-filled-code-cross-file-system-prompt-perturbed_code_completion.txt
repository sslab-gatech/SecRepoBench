To fill in the masked region in the `OFFImporter::InternReadFile` function, we need to correctly parse the face data from the OFF file. The goal is to read the number of indices per face, validate the count, and populate the face indices correctly.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Read the Number of Indices**: For each face, read the number of indices. This tells us how many vertices make up the face.

2. **Validate the Index Count**: Ensure that the number of indices is at least 3, as a face must be a triangle or higher polygon. Log an error if invalid.

3. **Allocate Memory for Indices**: Based on the number of indices, allocate memory for the face's indices array.

4. **Read Each Index**: For each index in the face, read the vertex index from the buffer. Ensure it's within valid range; if not, clamp it to the maximum valid index.

5. **Handle Invalid Faces**: If a face has fewer than 3 indices, skip it to avoid adding invalid data to the mesh.

Here's the code that implements these steps:
