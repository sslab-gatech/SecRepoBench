// Check if the current dictionary entry is forbidden in compound words
// by checking for `COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG`. If it is forbidden and not allowed
// by the Hungarian movement rule (`hu_mov_rule`), handle the case by either
// breaking out of a potential infinite loop or continuing the search for
// valid dictionary entries based on specific conditions such as simplified
// compound processing (`simplifiedcpd`).
// Adjust compound word boundaries if necessary.
//
// Iterate through homonyms of the current entry to find one with the
// required compound conditions. This includes conditions based on compound
// flags such as `compoundflag`, `compoundbegin`, `compoundmiddle`, and
// checks against specific compound pattern conditions (`checkcpdtable`).
// The process ensures that only valid compound components are accepted
// and it skips over invalid ones by moving to the next homonym.
