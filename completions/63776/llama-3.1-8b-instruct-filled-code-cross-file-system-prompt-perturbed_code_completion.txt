  // This code block handles the size validation and unknown data extraction for DWG objects in pre-R11 and later versions.
  // For pre-R11 versions, the code checks if the object's size is valid and within the bounds of the data, adjusting it if necessary.
  // It extracts any unknown remaining data if the object size doesn't match the current data position and logs errors if issues are found.
  // For later versions, additional CRC checks are performed to ensure data integrity, and adjustments are made to account for any size discrepancies.
  // If the object's address and size don't align with the data position, the code calculates the offset for any trailing unknown data and allocates memory to store it, logging appropriate messages.
