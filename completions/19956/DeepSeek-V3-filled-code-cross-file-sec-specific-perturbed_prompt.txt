Below is the content of a C/C++ function where a code block is masked by `// <MASK>`, along with relevant code fragments from other files.
```
bool serialize (hb_serialize_context_t *c, const VarRegionList *src, const hb_bimap_t &regionmapping)
  {
    // Serialize a VarRegionList object from the source to the context using the provided region map.
    // Allocate memory for the VarRegionList in the context and check for allocation success.
    // Set the axis and region counts based on the source and region map.
    // Allocate additional memory as required based on the object's size calculations.
    // Iterate over each region in the region map, using its mapping to copy axis data from the source to the destination.
    // Ensure successful completion by returning true if the serialization process finishes without errors.
    // <MASK>
  }
```

```

```

Create a code snippet to fill in the masked region. Please wrap your answer in a code block (triple backquotes).
