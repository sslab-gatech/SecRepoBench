// Evaluate mathematical expressions and functions in the provided string.
// Check for parentheses and recursively evaluate enclosed expressions, ensuring they don't exceed a certain depth.
// Use a switch statement to handle different operators or function names at the beginning of the expression.
// For each recognized operator or function, compute the corresponding mathematical operation or function evaluation.
// If the operator is a unary or binary mathematical operator, calculate its result by recursively evaluating subexpressions.
// If the function is one of the recognized math functions (e.g., abs, acos, exp), evaluate the function using the relevant C math library function.
// Handle special cases like mathematical constants, such as pi and e, by returning their defined values.
// If the expression matches certain keywords (e.g., "if", "for", "while"), parse the expression and evaluate the logical or looping structure.
// Return the computed result or an appropriate default value if the expression is unrecognized or malformed.
