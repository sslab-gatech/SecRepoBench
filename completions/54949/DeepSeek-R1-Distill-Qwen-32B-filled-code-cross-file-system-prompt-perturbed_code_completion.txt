Okay, I need to figure out how to fill in the masked region in the given C/C++ function. Let's look at the context provided.

The function is `plist_from_openstep`, which parses an OpenStep property list. The masked region is inside an `else if` block where `ctx.pos` is less than `ctx.end` and the current character is '='. The comment suggests that the code should attempt to parse the data as a dictionary of strings. If parsing fails, it should free the plist and set an error. If it succeeds, assign the new dictionary to `plist`.

Looking at the code, after the `else if`, the code is supposed to handle the case where the plist is a dictionary of strings. So, I think the code should call a function to parse this dictionary.

In the provided code fragments, I see that `node_from_openstep` is used to parse nodes. Maybe there's a similar function for parsing strings. Alternatively, perhaps the code should call a function like `parse_strings` or something similar.

Wait, in the `node_from_openstep` function, when it encounters a '{', it parses a dictionary. So, perhaps in this case, the code should parse the remaining part as a dictionary of strings.

But the current code after the `else if` is empty. So, I need to write code that parses the data as a dictionary of strings.

Looking at the code, after the `else if`, the code should:

1. Attempt to parse the data as a dictionary of strings.
2. If parsing fails, free the allocated plist and set an error code.
3. If parsing succeeds, assign the newly created dictionary to `plist`.

So, perhaps the code should call a function like `parse_strings` or `parse_dict_of_strings` and handle the result.

But in the provided code, I don't see such a function. Alternatively, maybe the code should create a new dictionary and parse each key-value pair as strings.

Wait, perhaps the code should create a new dictionary and then parse each key and value as strings. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the code should call `node_from_openstep` again to parse the next part as a dictionary.

Wait, the current code is inside the `plist_from_openstep` function, which calls `node_from_openstep` to parse the initial node. If the initial node is not a dictionary, but the file ends with '=', perhaps it's expecting a dictionary of strings.

So, perhaps the code should create a new dictionary, then parse each key-value pair as strings.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure.

In the `node_from_openstep` function, when it sees a '{', it parses a dictionary. So, perhaps in this case, the code should parse the remaining part as a dictionary.

But the current code is in the `plist_from_openstep` function, which after parsing the initial node, checks if there's a '=' left. So, perhaps the code should parse the remaining part as a dictionary.

Wait, but the initial call to `node_from_openstep` may have parsed a node, and now we're checking if there's a '=' left, which might indicate that the plist is a dictionary of strings.
