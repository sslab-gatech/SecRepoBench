The relevant code fragments from the `tiff.c` file show the `ReadTIFFImage` and `WriteTIFFImage` functions, which are responsible for reading and writing TIFF images, respectively. The `ReadTIFFImage` function initializes a TIFF image structure and reads the image data from a TIFF file, while the `WriteTIFFImage` function initializes a TIFF image structure and writes the image data to a TIFF file. Both functions use the TIFF library to interact with the TIFF file format
