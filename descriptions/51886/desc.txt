// Assigns the given source data to the storage, setting the number of elements to `count`.
// Ensures `count` is non-negative. If `count` is greater than the current reserved space
// or storage is not large enough to accommodate the new data, it reallocates storage to
// fit the new data size. Copies the data from `src` into the storage if `count` is greater
// than zero and `src` is not null. The resulting storage will contain `count` elements
// of the specified size, and the storage is resized accordingly.
