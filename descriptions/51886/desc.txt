// Assigns new data to the storage from the source pointer `src` for a specified number of 
// elements `count` each of size `sizeOfT`. Ensures that the storage is resized accordingly. 
// If `count` is greater than zero, it updates the storage, either reallocating to fit the new 
// size or shrinking to fit exactly, depending on the implementation. Uses assertions to 
// validate input and performs memory copy if the source is not null.
