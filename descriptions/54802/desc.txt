// Check specific byte patterns in the packet payload to identify PPStream traffic.
// These patterns include checking certain bytes for specific hexadecimal values,
// often at various offsets within the payload.
// If a known pattern is matched, it indicates PPStream traffic over UDP.
// Upon detection, increment the PPStream stage counter for the flow.
// Then, register this flow as a PPStream connection.
// If no pattern is matched, continue with the flow's protocol exclusion.
