// Retrieve the size of the tile-part header from the packed headers stream.
// This header size is then used to initialize a bytestream for the tile-part header,
// and the stream is advanced by the header size. This process is part of handling
// the JPEG2000 main headers when PPM (Packed Packet Headers, Main Header) is present.
