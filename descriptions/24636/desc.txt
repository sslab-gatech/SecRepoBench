// Extract the size of the tile-part header from the packed headers stream.
// Depending on the implementation choice, the extraction can either:
// 1. Directly read the next 32 bits as an unsigned integer to determine the size.
// 2. Read the next 32 bits as an unsigned integer and then validate if the
//    remaining bytes in the packed headers stream are sufficient for the header size.
//    If not, return an error indicating invalid data.
