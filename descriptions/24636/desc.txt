// Initialize the bytestream for tile-part headers using packed header streams if PPM is present.
// Initialize the bytestream for packed packet headers if PPT is present and it's the first tile-part.
// Set up the data stream for the current tile-part by calculating its size and skipping to its end in the buffer.
// Continue to the next iteration of the loop to process more headers or reach the end marker.
