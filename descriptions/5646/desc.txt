// This function extracts the next token from a given character sequence
// starting at 'start', and stores it in 'token'. Tokens are sequences of
// characters delimited by whitespace, quotes, parentheses, or specific
// separator characters such as ':', '=', ',', or ';'. The function skips
// leading whitespace and handles escaped characters inside quoted strings.
// It distinguishes between quoted and non-quoted tokens, recognizing different
// quote characters ('"', '\'', '`', '{'). After processing, it updates the
// 'end' pointer to point to the character following the token. The function
// handles special cases such as URL-like tokens starting with "url(" and
// adjusts the 'token' content appropriately.
