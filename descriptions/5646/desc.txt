// This section parses tokens from a string, handling special cases like quotes,
// escape sequences, and specific punctuation. It uses a switch statement to 
// determine how to handle the current character, which may be a quote, a 
// forward slash, or other types. For quoted strings, it identifies the matching 
// end quote and collects the characters in between. If encountering a '/', it 
// checks for subsequent special characters. For other cases, it processes 
// numerical values or sequences not interrupted by whitespace or punctuation. 
// Special handling is done for URLs by trimming "url(" prefixes. The parsed 
// token is stored in the 'token' buffer, which must not exceed 'extent' length.
