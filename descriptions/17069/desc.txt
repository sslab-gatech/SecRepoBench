// Handle the case where there are unconsumed words left to process.
// Read the unary most significant bits (MSBs) and update the consumed words and bits count.
// Continue by reading the binary least significant bits (LSBs) if necessary.
// Compose the signed value by combining MSBs and LSBs, and store it in the output array.
// Update the internal state of the bitreader, ensuring the buffer is positioned correctly for subsequent reads.
