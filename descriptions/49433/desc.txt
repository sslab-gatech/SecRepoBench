// For each tag, cerify that the offset and size are valid and within the profile's header size.
// If valid, store the tag's signature, offset, and size in the profile structure.
// Check for existing tags with matching offsets and sizes to establish links between them.
// If a link is found, store the linked tag signature in the profile structure.
// Increment the tag count in the profile structure for each successfully processed tag.
