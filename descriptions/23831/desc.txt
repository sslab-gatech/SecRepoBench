// Check if the payload length equals 12, log detection of IAX, and add the connection if true.
// Otherwise, iterate through information elements in the payload.
// For each element, calculate the next element's starting position based on its length.
// If the calculated position equals the total payload length, log detection of IAX and add the connection.
