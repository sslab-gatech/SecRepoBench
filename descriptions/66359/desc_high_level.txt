// Search through the data buffer for a specific byte pattern, typically representing
// a start code, within a defined size limit. If the pattern does not match a certain
// string ("DivX"), skip ahead and continue searching. This is used to modify a flag
// in the context if a packed frame is detected. The modified flag indicates whether
// the video stream is packed or not, affecting how decoder configuration properties
// are set later in the function.
