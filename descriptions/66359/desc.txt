// The code iterates through a buffer `dcfg` to search for the occurrence of
// a specific byte pattern. It checks for the MPEG start code pattern (0x00 0x00 0x01)
// followed by the string "DivX". The loop continues until either the end of the buffer
// is reached or the pattern is found. If found, the frame is marked as 'packed'
// by setting the first character of the matched pattern to 'n'. If not found,
// the loop increments the index `i` to continue searching. The search ensures
// not to exceed the buffer size `vosh_size`.
