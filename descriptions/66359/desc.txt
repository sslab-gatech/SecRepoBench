// This code block iterates through the VOSH (Video Object Sequence Header) data
// looking for a specific pattern. It checks for the start code pattern (0x000001)
// followed by the string "DivX". If found, it searches for the character 'p'
// within the VOSH data to potentially modify it to 'n', indicating a packed 
// bitstream. The `ctx->forced_packed` flag is set to true if such a modification
// takes place. The loop breaks once the pattern is found and handled, or if the
// search reaches the end of the data without a complete match.
