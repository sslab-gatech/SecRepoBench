     * offset). While this is perfectly valid, it will cause some versions of

     * order, so that the offsets are ordered from small to large. Since
     * variation records are supposed to be in increasing order of varSelector
     * we then have to reverse the order of the written variation selector
     * records after everything is finalized.
