     * offset). While this is perfectly valid, it will cause some versions of
     * OTS to consider this table bad.
     *
     * So to prevent this issue we serialize the variation records in reverse
     * order, so that the offsets are ordered from small to large. Since
     * variation records are supposed to be in increasing order of varSelector
     * we then have to reverse the order of the written variation selector
     * records after everything is finalized.
