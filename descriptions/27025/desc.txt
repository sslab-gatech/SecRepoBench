// Assign the value from the configuration key-value pair to the appropriate field
// in the entry structure based on the map type. Handle different data types
// such as string, integer, double, size, time, boolean, and list. Convert the
// string value to the required type using utility functions if necessary.
// For boolean types, validate the value and handle errors by logging and
// freeing resources. For list types, parse the string into a list, validate
// the number of entries, and handle errors similarly. Ensure the entry is
// added to the map's list of multiple values if the map allows multiple entries.
