// Retrieve the class definition from the macro collection and inject
          // its elements into the current drawing stream. First, obtain the next
          // token, which represents the class name. If the class exists in the
          // macros tree and the token is not the current graphic context ID, 
          // inject the corresponding class elements at the current position in 
          // the drawing stream. Concatenate the class elements with the remaining 
          // content and update the primitive string to reflect these changes.
