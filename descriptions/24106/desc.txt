// Check if the current token matches the graphic context ID, break if true.
// Retrieve the MVG class definition from the macros using the token.
// If the class definition is found and the current pointer is valid,

// Concatenate the MVG class to the elements string, followed by the remaining content.
// Free the previous primitive string and update it with the new elements.
// Adjust the stream pointer to the new position in the modified primitive.
