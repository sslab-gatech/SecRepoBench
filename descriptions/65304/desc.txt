// Extract the signature algorithms from the packet payload starting from the given offset.
// Calculate the number of signature algorithms and store it in the appropriate field.
// Optionally, copy the signature algorithms into a dedicated structure if a specific flag is enabled.
// Convert each signature algorithm to a string format and append it to a string buffer for logging or further processing.
