// Process tags within the crypto data by iterating over them.
// For each tag, check if it is either "SNI\0" or "UAID".
// If the tag is "SNI\0", extract the server name information (SNI) from the crypto data
// and store it in the flow structure's SNI field. Log the SNI for debugging purposes.
// Perform matching of the SNI against known subprotocols and check for DGA.
// Mark the hello message as processed once SNI is handled.
// If the tag is "UAID", extract the user agent information from the crypto data,
// log it for debugging, and process it using the HTTP user agent handling function.
// Keep track of whether SNI or UAID have been found and return early if both are processed.
