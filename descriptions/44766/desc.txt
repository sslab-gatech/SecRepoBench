// Remove the ESD (Elementary Stream Descriptor) box from the parent box's list of children, if it exists. The function either removes the ESD box directly from the list of child boxes or iterates through the child boxes to ensure removal from any nested structures, then deletes the ESD box from memory. This ensures that the ESD box is no longer part of the box hierarchy and frees associated resources.
