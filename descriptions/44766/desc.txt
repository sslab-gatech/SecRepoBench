// Search the data buffer for a specific four-character code indicating an ESDS box type.
// If found, create a new bitstream starting at the identified location in the data buffer.
// Set a cookie on the new bitstream to suppress logging for the operations that follow.
// If an ESDS box already exists in the current box structure, remove its reference from the parent-child hierarchy and delete it.
// Parse a new ESDS box from the bitstream and update the ESDS box reference in the current box structure.
// If the parsing is successful and the box type matches ESDS, ensure the box is added to the list of child boxes.
// Clean up by deleting the created bitstream and handle any memory management necessary for ESDS box references.
