// The masked region is responsible for copying the 'options' string into 
// the 'id' buffer, which is used to store the image format identifier. 
// It ensures that the 'id' buffer is filled with the correct identifier 
// from the options provided. Additionally, in one implementation, it 
// checks if 'id' is not empty and raises an exception for an improper 
// image header before performing the copy.
