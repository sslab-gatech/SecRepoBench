// Assign the value of the 'options' string to the 'id' variable.
// This is done during the parsing of image attributes in the image header,
// specifically when the 'id' keyword is encountered in the file.
// The 'id' is expected to be a unique identifier for the image format,
// which will be used later in the function to verify proper image structure.
