// After detecting an end-of-line sequence followed by another end-of-line sequence (i.e., "\r\n\r\n"),
// calculate the remaining payload length from the current position plus 4 bytes.
// Then, copy a portion of the payload, starting after this end-of-line sequence, into the flow's initial binary bytes buffer.
// The size of the copied data should not exceed either the remaining payload length or the size of the flow's buffer.
// Store the number of bytes copied into the flow's initial binary bytes length.
