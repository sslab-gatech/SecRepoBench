// Allocate memory for TIFF pixels based on image dimensions, sample count, and bit depth.
// The allocation size considers the maximum of the scanline size, column-sample product,
// and column-row-product to ensure enough space for pixel data.
// If memory allocation fails, an exception is thrown for resource limit error.
// Depending on the TIFF reading method determined earlier, various strategies are used
// to convert the TIFF image data to a format suitable for processing, such as converting
// to PseudoClass or DirectClass MIFF image format. The conversion uses a loop to read
// through each row of the image, applying the appropriate quantum type and pixel data
// import method based on the current conversion requirements.
// The conversion also includes specific handling for different TIFF compression methods,
// interlace types, and color spaces, ensuring that the pixel data is accurately read
// and transformed into the desired image representation format.
// Error handling is included to terminate the process if any row fails to read or sync
// properly, ensuring data integrity and resource management.
