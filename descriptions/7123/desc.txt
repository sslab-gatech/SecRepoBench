// This code block handles reading TIFF image metadata and initializing image structures.
// It retrieves essential TIFF tags such as image width, height, compression, and photometric interpretation.
// Based on the photometric tag, it sets appropriate image properties such as color space.
// It also configures the image's resolution, orientation, and chromaticity.
// The code handles various TIFF compression methods and determines the appropriate reading method for the image data.
// It includes error handling for unsupported compression types and improperly formatted image headers.
// The block concludes by reading pixel data from TIFF and converting it to the appropriate ImageMagick format.
// Logging functionality is included to debug and trace important steps.
