// Check for TrueHD streams with more than 6 channels and MLP's noise type.
// If max_channel or max_matrix_channel exceeds the maximum supported value for
// MLP and the noise type is not set, the decoder may not support this case.
// Request a sample for further analysis and return an error indicating the need
