// This block reads the restart header from a bitstream for a specified substream 
// and initializes various decoding parameters for the substream. It starts by 
// checking the sync word to verify the correct header alignment. It extracts 
// the noise type, channel information (minimum, maximum, and matrix channels), 
// and checks for valid configurations of these parameters. The substream's 
// channel assignments are set up based on the extracted information. The block 
// also includes a checksum calculation to verify the integrity of the header data. 
// If the substream is the last decoded substream, it updates the channel layout 
// and configures the DSP context for output packing. Default decoding parameters 
// are set for all channels, including filter parameters and audio coding settings.
