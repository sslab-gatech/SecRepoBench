// Convert a string representing a floating-point number into a double value.
// The function skips leading whitespace and handles optional underscores in the numeric portion,
// treating underscores as separators that can be ignored between digits.
// If the string begins with a "0x" or "0X", it is interpreted as a hexadecimal and converted accordingly.
// The function checks for invalid characters and raises an error if 'badcheck' is true and the string
// contains invalid content such as null bytes or incorrect underscore usage.
// After parsing, the function uses 'mrb_float_read' to convert the valid portion of the string to a double.
