// Check if the chunk size is too large to be handled. Depending on the 
// chosen implementation, the size check either considers the full size 
// of the SF_CART_INFO_16K structure or excludes the 'tag_text_size' 
// field. If the chunk size is deemed too large, log a message and skip 
// over the chunk by reading and discarding its contents, then return 0.
