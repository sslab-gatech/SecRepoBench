// Parses the 'cart' chunk of a WAVE file, performing several checks
// on the chunk size to ensure it falls within acceptable bounds. If 
// the size is valid, it allocates memory for an SF_CART_INFO_16K 
// structure to store cart metadata and reads it from the file. It 
// logs the chunk size and handles cases where more than one cart 
// chunk is found. The function also checks for the presence of tag 
// text data and reads it if available.
