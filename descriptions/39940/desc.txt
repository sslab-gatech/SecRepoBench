// The masked block performs a method call setup in the mruby virtual machine.
// It checks for a negative argument count and raises an error if found.
// Then, it locates the method associated with the given symbol and class.
// Depending on the method's presence and the number of arguments,
// it may convert the arguments to an array if the count exceeds a threshold.
// Additionally, it adjusts the stack size to accommodate the arguments and other call data.
