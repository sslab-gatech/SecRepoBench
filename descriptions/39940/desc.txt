// The code block is responsible for setting up a method call within the mruby virtual machine.
// It initializes necessary variables and performs sanity checks, such as ensuring the argument count is non-negative
// and the call stack depth does not exceed the defined maximum.
// The block handles both defined method calls and method_missing scenarios.
// It manages argument passing and stack extension, including handling variable argument lists.
// If the method is defined and implemented as a C function, it calls it directly.
// Otherwise, it sets up the call information and executes the Ruby method using `mrb_run`.
