// Check if the current child node is a non-greedy, range-any node with a
// range that exceeds a specified threshold. If so, split the AST at this
// point. Create a new AST for the remainder and update the current AST
// to separate the nodes before and after the point of splitting.
// Update the min_gap and max_gap with the range values of the current node.
// Ensure the child node is properly removed, and return success after
// successfully splitting the AST.
