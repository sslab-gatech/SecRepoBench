// Initialize the IOSystem and open the LWS file for reading.
// Verify if the file was successfully opened, throwing an error if not.
// Allocate a memory buffer and fill it with the contents of the file for parsing.
// Initialize the root element of the LWS file structure and parse it from the buffer.
// Set up a BatchLoader to handle recursive file imports, and prepare a list to store nodes.
// Define counters for lights, cameras, and objects in the scene.
// Check for the presence of the 'LWSC' identifier to confirm the file format.
// Retrieve the file format version and set default animation parameters like frame rate.
// Iterate through the parsed elements, extracting and processing each relevant property such as:
//     - Animation frames and frame rates
//     - Object loading and hierarchy setup
//     - Animation channels and envelopes
//     - Camera and light properties like intensity, type, and color
// Resolve node parenting and build a hierarchy by attaching child nodes to their parents.
// Load referenced external files and build the scene graph recursively, attaching loaded files.
// Allocate storage for cameras and lights, and set up the master scene graph with root nodes.
// Construct animation channels and convert the master scene to right-handed coordinate system.
// Merge the master scene with attachments into the final scene and check for completeness.
// Construct a skeleton mesh if necessary, based on the presence of animations.
