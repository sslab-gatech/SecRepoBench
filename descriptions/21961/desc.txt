// The code block implements reading different types of TIFF images using various methods.
// It includes cases for handling YCCK, stripped, tiled, and generic TIFF images.
// For YCCKMethod, the code reads and converts YCCK (CMYK) pixel values from the TIFF.
// For ReadStripMethod, it reads image data in strips, iterating over each strip to populate the image pixels.
// For ReadTileMethod, it processes a tiled TIFF image by reading and converting each tile to the image pixels.
// The default ReadGenericMethod handles TIFF images using the TIFFReadRGBAImage function to convert pixels.
