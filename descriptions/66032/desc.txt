// Strip leading whitespace and newline characters from the probe_data buffer.
// This loop iterates over the probe_data, advancing the pointer past any
// whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and newlines.
// Depending on the implementation choice, the loop may decrement the probe_size
// to keep track of the remaining data length or simply advance the pointer without
// adjusting the size.
