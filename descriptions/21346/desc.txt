// Extract and parse IRC commands from packet lines.
// Check if the command is one of SEND, CHAT, chat, sslchat, or TSEND.
// If a command is detected, advance the index to process further.
// Iterate through the characters in the line to identify spaces and the port number.
// After the third space, attempt to read the port number from the line.
// If a valid port is found and the source or destination structure is not NULL, store the port.
// If the IRC port array is not full, add the new port unless it's a duplicate.
// If the array is full, replace the least recently used port with the new one if not a duplicate.
// Update the timestamp of the last IRC activity for source or destination.
