// Iterate through the list of cipher suites in the client's TLS handshake message.
// For each cipher suite, convert it from network byte order to host byte order.
// Skip cipher suites that match the GREASE pattern.
// For each non-GREASE cipher suite, add the cipher ID to the client's JA3 cipher list.
// Count the number of Safari and Chrome specific cipher suites to perform heuristic checks.
// Identify if the cipher suite looks like Safari on Big Sur for further browser heuristics.
