// Function to read and validate the ICC profile header and tag directory.
// Reads the profile header and checks for a valid ICC signature.
// Adjusts endianness for various header parameters and populates them into
// the profile structure. Extracts profile creation date and time, and the
// profile ID from the header.
// Reads the tag directory, validates the tag count, and performs sanity
// checks on each tag to ensure offsets and sizes fall within the profile
// bounds. For each tag, populates its signature, offset, and size into
// the profile structure, and identifies linked tags sharing the same data.
// Returns TRUE if successful or FALSE if any step fails, including reading
// errors, invalid signature, excessive tags, or other inconsistencies.
