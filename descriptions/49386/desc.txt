// Loop through each tag entry in the profile's tag directory, reading the tag signature,
// offset, and size from the IO handler. Perform basic sanity checks to ensure the tag
// falls within the bounds of the file. If a tag passes the checks, record its signature,
// offset, and size in the Icc structure. Additionally, search for and record any links
// between tags that share the same offset and size, indicating they are linked. Finally,
// increment the tag count for each valid tag entry processed. Return TRUE if the tags are successfully read and processed.
