// Iterate over the number of tags as indicated by TagCount. For each tag,
// read its signature, offset, and size from the input handler. Perform a
// sanity check to ensure that the tag's offset and size are within the
// valid range of the file. If valid, store the tag's signature, offset,
// and size into the ICC profile structure's arrays. Check for any links
// by comparing the current tag with previously read tags, and update
// link information if matches are found. Increment the tag count after
// successful processing of each tag. At the end, return TRUE if tags are
// successfully read and processed.
