// Iterate through all files in the opened ZIP archive.
// For each file, retrieve its file information including the filename and uncompressed size.
// If the file's uncompressed size is not zero, create a string from the filename with a specified length.
// Simplify the filename by removing unnecessary characters or directory structures.
// Add the simplified filename and associated file information to the archive map for later access.
