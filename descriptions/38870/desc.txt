// Retrieves information for the current file within the ZIP archive. It checks the file's uncompressed size
// to ensure it's not zero and constructs a filename string using the provided buffer. The filename is then
// simplified by removing unnecessary components. The simplified filename is used as a key to map the 
// file information in the archive map, using the filename as the key and a ZipFileInfo instance containing
// the file handle and uncompressed size as the value. The process iterates over all files in the archive.
