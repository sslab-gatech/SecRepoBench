// Parse the payload of the packet to identify and extract lines separated by "\r\n" sequences.
// For each line, calculate its length and store it in the packet structure.
// If a sequence "\r\n\r\n" is encountered, extract subsequent bytes and store them in the flow's initial binary bytes.
// Analyze the first line to detect and process HTTP response status codes.
// Identify and extract specific HTTP headers such as "Server:", "Host:", "Content-Type:", etc., storing their positions and lengths.
// Count the number of headers found in the packet.
// Mark the position of any empty lines, if encountered.
// Continue parsing until the end of the payload or the maximum number of lines is reached.
