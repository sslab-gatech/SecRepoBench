// Read and process each line representing a face from the buffer. For each face,
// retrieve the number of indices and allocate memory for them. Parse the indices,
// ensuring they are within the valid range of vertex indices, and store them in
// the face structure. If a face has invalid indices or none at all, log an error
// message and adjust the face count accordingly. Iterate over the number of faces
// specified, and update the faces array with the parsed data.
