// Parse face data from the input buffer for the OFF format. For each face, read
// the number of vertex indices, followed by the indices themselves. Ensure that
// the number of indices does not exceed a specified maximum, and that all indices
// are within the valid range of existing vertices. Log an error if indices are out
// of range or if faces with zero indices are encountered. Depending on the snippet,
// either continue processing despite errors or throw an exception for header issues.
