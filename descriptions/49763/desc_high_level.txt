// Implement the division of large unsigned integers using an iterative algorithm.
// For each possible position in the quotient, estimate a candidate quotient digit
// and adjust the dividend accordingly. The loop continues until all positions
// are processed, ensuring that the dividend is reduced while adjusting the
// quotient and remainder as necessary. The final quotient is stored in `q` and
// is later moved to `qq`, while the remainder is adjusted and stored in `rr`
// after reversing any prior left-shifts used to align the divisor.
