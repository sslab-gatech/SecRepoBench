// This code block implements the division of multi-precision integers using a long division algorithm.
// It computes the quotient (q) and updates the remainder (x) by iterating over the digits of the dividend.
// For each digit, a trial quotient (qhat) is calculated and used to adjust the remainder.
// It handles multi-digit divisions by scaling and adjusting the operands accordingly.
// The loop iterates over the difference in digit count between the dividend and divisor, updating the quotient q.
