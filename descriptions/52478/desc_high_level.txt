// Handles the pre-behavior of animation keyframes for each envelope by modifying
// the keys based on specified behavior types (OffsetRepeat, Repeat, and Oscillate).
// For these behaviors, it calculates the starting time offset and adjusts the
// keys by potentially duplicating and rearranging them. It performs full copies
// of the existing keys to cover the pre-behavior period and may reverse the order
// of keys for oscillation behavior. It also updates the time and value of keys
// when the pre-behavior is OffsetRepeat, adding a value offset proportional
// to the number of repetitions.
