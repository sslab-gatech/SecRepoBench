// Iterate over a list of animation envelopes to process pre and post behaviors
// for each envelope. For envelopes with keys, calculate the time delta between
// the first and last key. Based on the pre-behavior type (OffsetRepeat, Repeat,
// Oscillate), insert and modify keys to extend the envelope to start earlier
// than the first key. Insert copies of the original key range to fill the time
// before the first key, adjusting key times and values according to the
// behavior. For OffsetRepeat, incrementally add the value delta to keys. 
// The process is similar for post-behavior handling, preparing the envelope
// to extend beyond the last key. This prepares envelopes for interpolation
// during animation.
