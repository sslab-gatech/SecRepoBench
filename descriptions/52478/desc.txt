// Handles the pre-behavior of LightWave envelopes by inserting additional keyframes
// for pre-defined behaviors such as OffsetRepeat, Repeat, and Oscillate. This involves
// calculating the time delta between keys and adjusting keyframe values accordingly.
// The logic uses the start time, end time, and value delta to calculate new keyframe
// positions and values, adapting to the pre-behavior type.
