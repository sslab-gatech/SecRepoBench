// Check if a sequence of two consecutive CR+LF ("\r\n\r\n") is present in the payload
// after the current CR+LF position. If found, calculate the remaining payload length
// beyond the sequence. Limit this length to the size of the `flow->initial_binary_bytes`
// buffer and copy the data into it. Update the length of the copied data in
// `flow->initial_binary_bytes_len`.
