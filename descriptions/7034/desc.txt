// Assert that the draw_info pointer is not NULL.
// Log the beginning of the draw-dash process if debugging is enabled.
// Calculate the number of vertices by iterating over the primitive_info array until an undefined primitive is found.
// Allocate memory for the dash_polygon array to store points for the dashed polygon, considering the number of vertices.
// Return false if memory allocation fails.
// Clone the draw_info structure to use in creating the dashed polygon.
// Set the miter limit of the cloned draw_info to zero for line joins.
// Initialize the first element of the dash_polygon with the first element of the primitive_info.
// Calculate the scale factor from the affine transformation in the draw_info.
// Calculate the initial dash length and offset based on the dash pattern and dash offset from the draw_info.
