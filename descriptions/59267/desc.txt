// Define pointers for compressed data sections: UNKNOWN, AC, DC, and RLE.
// Verify that the input size is adequate for the expected header size.
// Initialize the uncompressed data buffer to zero.
// Copy header information into an array and convert it from XDR format to native format.
// Extract various sizes and counters related to compression from the header information.
// Calculate the total size of compressed data sections.
// Adjust the data pointer to skip the header and calculate the remaining data size.
// Verify that compressed data sizes do not exceed the input size to prevent overflow.
// Check version information to determine channel rules, updating them if necessary.
// Initialize buffers and allocate the output buffer for uncompressed data.
// Determine buffer pointers for AC and DC data, if available.
// Set pointers to the start of each compressed data section: UNKNOWN, AC, DC, and RLE.
