// Initialize variables for tracking uncompressed bytes, block sizes, and index positions.
// Calculate the stopping position based on the start position and number of items.
// Check if there are no items to process and return early if so.
// Validate that the destination buffer is large enough for the decompressed data.
// Set up block start positions based on the source buffer and context.
// Verify that the start and stop positions are within valid bounds for the data.
// Determine if the data should be treated as memcpyed based on header flags or context type.
// Handle special cases for data that is memcpyed or has specific characteristics.
