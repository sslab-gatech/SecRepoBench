// Iterate through the payload to validate the presence of a specified number of numeric sequences,
// each followed by a space. If the expected format is not met, exit the processing.
// Continue scanning the payload for alphanumeric characters until a newline character is found.
// If the format is correctly identified and the state progresses past a threshold, ensure the cache
// exists, adding an entry for the flow's connection information if necessary.
// Log the detection of a tinc TCP connection and update the detection protocol state.
