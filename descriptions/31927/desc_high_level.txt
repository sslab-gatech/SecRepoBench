// Read the sample sizes from the bitstream based on the sample size specification.
// For a sample size of 4 bits, read two samples at a time, handling the case of an odd sample count by reading a padding value.
// For other sample sizes, read one sample at a time.
// Update the maximum sample size encountered, the total size of all samples, and the total number of samples processed.
