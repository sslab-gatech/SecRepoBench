// Handle DWARF attribute forms that indicate offsets to other entries within
// the same compilation unit. Specifically, handle DW_FORM_ref1, DW_FORM_ref2,
// and DW_FORM_ref4. Extract the offset value from the attribute pointer for
// these forms. For DW_FORM_ref1, directly assign the byte value as the offset.
// For DW_FORM_ref2 and DW_FORM_ref4, read the unaligned data using their
// respective sizes. Use a `goto` statement to jump to the `fixoffset` label
// to further process the offset into a global offset.
