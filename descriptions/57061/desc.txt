// Attempt to reallocate memory for the step operations array to double its 
// current size. If the memory allocation fails, log an error and increment 
// the error count in the stylesheet context if available. In the first 
// snippet, free the provided value and value2 if they exist before returning 
// an error code. In either case, upon successful reallocation, update the 
// maximum number of steps and assign the newly allocated memory to the 
// steps pointer.
