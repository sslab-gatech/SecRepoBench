// Attempt to reallocate memory for the step operations array to double its 
// current size. If the memory allocation fails, log an error and increment 
// the error count in the stylesheet context if available. Upon successful 
// reallocation, update the maximum number of steps and assign the newly 
// allocated memory to the steps pointer.
