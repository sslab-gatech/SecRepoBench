// Check if the number of steps in the compiled match exceeds the maximum allowed.
// If it does, attempt to reallocate memory for the steps array to double its current size.
// Handle potential memory allocation failure by logging an error, updating the error count in the stylesheet,
// and returning -1 to indicate failure. If memory allocation succeeds, update the maxStep value.
