// Attempt to reallocate memory for the steps array to accommodate
// additional steps if the current number of steps has reached the
// maximum capacity. If memory reallocation fails, log an error message,
// update the error count in the style context if available, and clean
// up any resources as needed before returning with an error status.
// If successful, update the maximum capacity of steps and assign the
// reallocated memory back to the steps array.
