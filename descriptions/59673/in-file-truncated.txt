    // This code snippet handles half-pel motion compensation in low-resolution
    // mode for MPEG video decoding. It accounts for motion vectors and adjusts
    // chroma (color) components based on pixel format. The snippet calculates
    // source positions and applies edge emulation if motion goes beyond the
    // frame boundaries. It processes luma and chroma planes separately, 
    // considering field-based encoding and half-pel accuracy. The snippet uses
    // pix_op functions for chroma motion compensation, depending on the lowres
    // level and pixel format (e.g., H263, H261). It includes handling for 
    // specific quirks like quarter-pixel motion and gray mode, ensuring 
    // proper image construction.
