// Calculate the source and destination positions for Y, Cb, and Cr components based on the given motion vectors
// and field information. Adjust the motion vectors for quarter sample motion precision if required. Depending on
// the output format (H263 or H261), determine the chroma motion vectors and source positions, taking into account
// chroma subsampling (Chroma422 or Chroma444). If necessary, handle edge emulation for pixels outside the frame
// boundaries, and adjust pointers to the emulated edges. Finally, perform motion compensation using the pixel
// operation functions for Y, Cb, and Cr components, adjusting for low resolution settings.
