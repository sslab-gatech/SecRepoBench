// Perform a memory search to find the first occurrence of the substring
// 'xs' of length 'm' within the larger string 'ys' of length 'n'.
// The function utilizes bitwise operations and a loop to efficiently
// scan through the 'ys' string in chunks of 'bitint' size. It compares
// the first and last characters of the chunk with the corresponding
// characters of the substring 'xs'. If a potential match is found,
// it verifies the remaining characters using 'memcmp'. If a match is
// found, it returns the starting index of the substring within 'ys'.
// If no match is found, it returns -1.
