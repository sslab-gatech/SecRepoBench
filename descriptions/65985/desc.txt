// Check if there are any bytes stored in the header buffer `hdr_store` that need processing.
// If there are, attempt to find a start code within these bytes by appending new data.
// If a start code is found, determine its type and location.
// Adjust the parsing state accordingly, preparing to process the next video frame data.
// If no start code is found, treat the stored bytes as continuation of the previous data
// and dispatch them. Reset the header buffer `bytes_in_header` after processing.
