// Open the attribute "MATLAB_fields" from the dataset to retrieve its dataspace.
// Get the dataspace associated with the attribute to determine the number of fields.
// Check for any errors when retrieving the number of fields, and handle errors by
// closing open resources and returning an error code if necessary.
// Allocate memory to store the field names as variable-length structures.
