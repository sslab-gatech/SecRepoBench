// Implement a search mechanism that utilizes SIMD-like operations to
// efficiently find a substring within a larger string. The code block
// should calculate potential starting points by comparing the first
// and last characters of the substring against segments of the main
// string using bitwise operations. Once potential matches are identified,
// verify these matches by comparing the remaining characters of the
// substring. If a match is found, return the index of its occurrence in
// the main string. If no match is found in these segments, continue to
// search by incrementing through the main string, ensuring the entire
// main string is scanned before returning a result.
