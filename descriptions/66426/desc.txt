// Implement a function that performs a search within a byte array using
// a method inspired by "SIMD within a register" (SWAR) technique.
// The function takes a pattern and a text, represented as byte arrays, 
// and tries to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text.
// It accounts for both big-endian and little-endian architectures 
// when processing the bitwise logic to ensure compatibility.
// The function will return the index of the start of the match if found,
// or -1 if the pattern is not found within the text.
