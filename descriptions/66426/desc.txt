// This function implements a byte search algorithm using SIMD within a register (SWAR) technique.
// It searches for a substring 'xs' of length 'm' within a larger string 'ys' of length 'n'.
// The code uses bitwise operations to check multiple bytes at a time for potential matches,
// optimizing for faster processing on 32-bit or 64-bit architectures.
// The function returns the index of the first occurrence of 'xs' in 'ys', or -1 if not found.
// It handles both big-endian and little-endian architectures by using appropriate bit shifting.
