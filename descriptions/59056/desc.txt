// Insert the newly parsed element into the elements map. If the current token is null, check if 
// it's a top-level scope. If so, add the element to the elements map and return. If not top-level, 
// delete the element and throw a ParseError indicating an unexpected end of the file. If the current 
// token is not null, simply insert the element into the map. Note that `delete` and `delete_Element` 
// functions can be used interchangeably based on implementation specifics.
