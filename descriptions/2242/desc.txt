// Declare pointers and size variables to define the search region in the data.
// Check if the source string is valid and initialize the search length and pointer accordingly.
// Determine the byte count and line count for the search based on the flags and range in 'm'.
// If a line count flag is set, calculate the byte count by multiplying the line count by a constant.
// Otherwise, set the byte count to the specified range without line counting.
