// This block of code handles the post-processing of objects in a DWG file format,
// ensuring data consistency and handling extra data and CRC checks.
// For objects in pre-R11 versions, it checks if the object size matches the expected size.
// If there is a discrepancy, it calculates the offset of unknown data and stores it.
// For objects in later versions, it also handles the CRC16 check, adjusting the byte position
// as needed and logging any errors or discrepancies. If any additional data exists beyond the
// expected size, it is read and stored as unknown data, and CRC checks are performed to validate
// the integrity of the data block. If the object size is invalid, it is adjusted and an error is logged.
