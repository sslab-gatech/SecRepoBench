// Extract macros from the MVG string. The code iterates through the string 
// to find 'push' and 'pop' commands, handling nested structures accordingly.
// It skips comments starting with '#'. When a complete macro is identified, 
// it extracts the macro definition and adds it to a splay tree 
// for later retrieval using the macro name as the key.
