// Named macro extraction for drawing operations.
// This code extracts and stores macros from a string of drawing operations.
// It identifies named sections of the drawing instructions (e.g., "push" and "pop" graphic contexts) 
// and stores them as macros in a splay tree for later use.
// The process involves scanning for "push" and "pop" keywords to delineate macro boundaries,
// handling comments, and storing the extracted macros with their names in a splay tree.
