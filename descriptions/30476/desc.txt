// Compares two expressions to determine if they are identical, specifically when
// the left side is an lvalue. It first checks if the kinds and types of both 
// expressions match, and then uses a switch statement to further compare the 
// components of different expression kinds like IntLiteral, FieldAccess, Index, 
// Swizzle, and VariableReference. If all components match, it returns true, 
// indicating the expressions are identical.
