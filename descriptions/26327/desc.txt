// Check if the time string does not include the year.
// If the year is missing, use the current date to fill in the missing year.
// Create a temporary buffer to hold the modified time string with the year.
// Concatenate the current year to the beginning of the time string.
// Use `gmtime_r` to get the current date and fill the missing month and day.
// Parse the modified time string with the year using `flb_strptime` and store results in `tm`.
// If the time string includes the year, copy it to a temporary buffer ensuring it is null-terminated.
// Parse the time string using `flb_strptime` with the expected format and store results in `tm`.
