// Process auxiliary data tags from the BAM record. This involves parsing
// specific tags ('RG:Z', 'MD:Z', 'NM:i') and handling them according to
// CRAM encoding rules. For each recognized tag, update the temporary
// dictionary block 'td_b' and the global and container-level tag usage
// maps. Special handling is done for different data types (e.g., string,
// integer) and CRAM major version differences, involving appending the
// tags to blocks and initializing appropriate codecs. If the tag is not
// recognized or requires special handling, it may be stored verbatim.
// Auxiliary tags are encoded and stored in appropriate blocks, and any
// missing or erroneous tags are logged.
