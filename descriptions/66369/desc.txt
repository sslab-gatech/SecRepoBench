// This code block handles the processing of auxiliary tags during CRAM
// encoding. It checks the presence of specific tags like RG (Read Group),
// MD (Mismatch Description), and NM (Number of Mismatches) and applies
// specific logic to either store them directly, append special markers,
// or log warnings if expected header records are missing. The block also
// manages the encoding of auxiliary data, creating and using codecs based
// on the tag's type (e.g., string, integer, float). For container-level
// tracking, it adds integer keys to a tag map and uses these keys to
// initialize and configure the codecs, updating both slice-level and
// global CRAM metrics as appropriate. Each auxiliary tag's data is then
// appended to the corresponding blocks designated for external storage.
