// Parse through the XML string to identify and process different components of a DOCTYPE declaration.
// When encountering an ENTITY declaration, parse and store the entity definitions in the appropriate data structure.
// Handle both parameter and general entities, updating predefined entities as needed.
// Validate entity definitions and handle any errors or circular declarations appropriately.
// For ATTLIST declarations, parse and store default attributes, managing memory for new attribute tags as necessary.
// Ensure that malformed or incomplete declarations are handled by throwing appropriate exceptions.
// Process comments and processing instructions by identifying their boundaries and calling appropriate processing functions.
// Continue parsing until the end of the DOCTYPE declaration or the input string is reached.
