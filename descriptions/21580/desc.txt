// If the iterator is null, set the starting glyph index and class value length to zero, and return true.
// Determine the minimum and maximum glyph indices from the iterator to calculate the glyph count.
// Set the starting glyph index to the minimum glyph index.
// Serialize the class value using the serialization context and the calculated glyph count.
// Iterate over the glyph-class pairs in the iterator, and assign the class value to each glyph index relative to the starting glyph index.
// Return true to indicate successful serialization.
