// Check if the packet is a UDP packet, specifically targeting a known Spotify port.
// If it is, verify the payload for a specific Spotify identifier to recognize Spotify traffic.
// If recognized, log the detection and mark the flow as a Spotify connection, returning early from the function.
// If the packet is not a UDP packet, check if it is a TCP packet and analyze the payload for specific byte patterns
// indicative of Spotify, logging and marking the protocol as Spotify if detected.
// Further, analyze IP packets by checking if the source or destination IP addresses fall within specific known Spotify
// IP ranges. If they do, log the detection and set the detected protocol as Spotify, then return from the function.
