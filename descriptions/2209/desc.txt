// Attempt to find a reference frame in the DPB with a given POC (picture order count).
// If the found reference is the same as the current reference or if the list has reached its maximum capacity, 
// return an error to prevent adding a duplicate or overflow.
// If no reference is found, attempt to generate a missing reference frame for the given POC.
// Return an error if the generation fails due to memory constraints.
