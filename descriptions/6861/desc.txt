// Ensure that the draw_info pointer is not NULL.
// If image debugging is enabled, log the beginning of the draw-dash process.
// Determine the number of vertices in the primitive_info array by iterating through it until an UndefinedPrimitive is found.
// Allocate memory for the dash_polygon array based on the number of vertices, ensuring there's enough space for additional vertices.
// If memory allocation fails, return MagickFalse indicating an error.
// Clone the draw_info to prepare for modifications specific to this function.
// Initialize the miterlimit of the cloned draw_info to 0 for dash drawing purposes.
// Initialize the first element of the dash_polygon with the first element of primitive_info.
// Calculate the scale based on the affine transformation in the draw_info.
// Initialize the length based on the first element of the dash_pattern, applying the scale.
// Calculate the offset based on the dash_offset, applying the scale if the offset is above a certain threshold.
