// Checks the size of the parent box against the size of the current box being parsed.
// If the current box size exceeds the remaining parent box size, it sets the parent
// box's size to zero. Optionally, when the 'no-check' option is not set, deletes the
// current box and returns an error indicating the file is invalid.
