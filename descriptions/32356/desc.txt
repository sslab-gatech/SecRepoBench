// Ensure the parsed box `a` is not NULL, and if it is, return success indicating no further processing is needed.
// Check if the size of the parent box is smaller than the size of the newly parsed box `a`. If it is, log a warning if logging is enabled.
// Adjust the parent box size by subtracting the size of the parsed box `a`, or reset it if the size was exceeded.
// Validate if the container box type is compatible with the parsed box `a`. This involves checking if the parent box type is a valid type for the current box using predefined rules in the registry.
// Log a warning if the parsed box is invalid in its current container, but only if logging is not skipped.
