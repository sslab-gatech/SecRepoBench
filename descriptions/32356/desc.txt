// When parsing a box from the bitstream, ensure that its size does not exceed
// the size of its parent container. If the 'no-check' option is not enabled,
// delete the box and return an invalid file error. Otherwise, proceed without
// returning an error, allowing the file parsing to continue despite the size discrepancy.
