// When a parsed box (`a`) is larger than the remaining size of the parent box,
// reset the parent's size to zero. Optionally, in configurations that require
// additional verification, delete the oversized box and return an error code
// indicating an invalid file before resetting the parent's size. This ensures
// correct handling of box size mismatches during parsing, maintaining container integrity.
