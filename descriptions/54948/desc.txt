// Parse a quoted string from the input context, handling escape characters.
// Traverse the input until a matching closing quote is found, ensuring it is not escaped.
// Count escape characters encountered during parsing for later processing.
// If the end of input is reached without finding the closing quote, log an error and set the error flag.
// Calculate the length of the parsed string and allocate memory to store it.
// Proceed to the next character after the closing quote for further parsing.
