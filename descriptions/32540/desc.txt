// Check if the current set of glyphs for the given lookup index has already been processed.
// If not, update the glyph count for this lookup index and ensure the glyph set is initialized
// and cleared as needed. Then, obtain the glyph set associated with the lookup index.
// Determine if the parent active glyphs are a subset of the obtained glyph set.
// If they are a subset, return true to indicate the lookup is done; otherwise, return false.
