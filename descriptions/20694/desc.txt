// Parse and validate reference sequence start and span values for a CRAM 
// mapped slice header. In Snippet 2, additional error checking is applied 
// to ensure the start and span values are non-negative, logging an error 
// and returning NULL if the validation fails. Snippet 1 does not include 
// this validation.
