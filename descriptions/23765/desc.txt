// Determine the starting position for parsing based on the parser context.
// Obtain a pointer to the input buffer and its length.
// Adjust the length to account for the number of characters in the search sequence.
// Iterate through the input buffer starting from the current position.
// Check for the beginning of comment sections and set flags accordingly.
// Skip content within attribute values if ignoring attribute values is enabled.
// Within comments, search for the end of the comment and adjust the position accordingly.
// Check if the current character matches the first character of the sequence being searched.
// If the subsequent characters match the second and third (if provided), return the position.
// Update the context's check index based on the current position after iteration.
