// Check if the CAPWAP control port is used in the source or destination,
// and if the first byte of the payload is 0x0 or 0x1.
// Calculate a message length from the payload using an offset and an additional length,
// depending on the first byte of the payload.
// Compare the calculated total length with the actual payload packet length.
// If they match, jump to the code block that handles a successful CAPWAP detection.
