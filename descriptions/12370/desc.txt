// Validate the slice parameters for consistency and correctness. 
// Check if the calculated offset for slice information exceeds the available buffer size, indicating potential data corruption.
// Additionally, ensure that the slice height is positive and, in one implementation, verify that the total height covered by all slices does not exceed the expected frame height.
// If any of these conditions are not met, return an error indicating invalid data.
