// Check if the codec ID is AV_CODEC_ID_HYMT and validate the buffer size
// and specific conditions at the end of the packet data. This helps determine
// the number of slices, slice height, and offset for slice information.
// The conditions ensure that the calculated offsets and sizes do not exceed
// the available buffer, and that the slice height is positive. If the conditions
// are not met, an error is returned. If the codec ID does not match, default to
// a single slice covering the full height.
