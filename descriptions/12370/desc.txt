// Validate the slice information for the HuffYUV MT codec. Check that
// the number of slices multiplied by 8 plus the slices_info_offset does
// not exceed the available buffer size, ensuring it is within the bounds
// minus a 16-byte offset used for additional data. Also, ensure that the
// slice_height is positive to prevent processing invalid slice dimensions.
