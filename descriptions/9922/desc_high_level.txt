// Handle escape sequences within the JSON string being parsed. This involves
// advancing the pointer to the next character and checking for valid escape
// characters or sequences. If a valid escape sequence is detected, processing
// continues. If an invalid sequence is encountered, the parsing is aborted
// and control is transferred to the error handling section.
