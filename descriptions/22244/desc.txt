// Analyze the packet payload to determine if it might be an OpenVPN packet.
// If the payload length is sufficient, adjust the payload pointer if it's over TCP.
// Extract the opcode from the payload and, if it's over UDP, perform additional checks:
//   - If the first packet in the flow matches specific length and opcode criteria, identify it as OpenVPN.
//   - Otherwise, check if the flow's OpenVPN counter is below a threshold and the opcode indicates a client reset.
//     - If so, attempt to extract and store the session ID from the payload.
//   - If the counter is within a range and the opcode indicates a server reset, verify the session ID matches.
//     - If a match is found, identify the protocol as OpenVPN; otherwise, mark the attempt as failed.
// Increment the flow's OpenVPN counter after processing.
// If the detection attempt fails, exclude the protocol from the flow's possible protocols.
