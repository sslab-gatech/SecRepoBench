// Compare two numerical values, v1 and v2, in the context of a Ruby-like environment.
// Check if either value is a big integer and handle this case separately using a specific comparison function for big integers.
// Determine the type of v1 and convert it into a numerical form suitable for comparison.
// Decide the type of variables x and y based on whether floating-point support is enabled, using integers if floating-point is disabled.
// Store the converted numerical value of v1 into the variable x for further comparison with v2.
