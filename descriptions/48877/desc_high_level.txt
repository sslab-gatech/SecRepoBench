// Compare two numerical values, considering the possibility of big integers.
// If either value is a big integer, delegate the comparison to a specialized
// function that can handle big integers. This ensures that the comparison
// logic accommodates all potential numerical types, including integers,
// floating-point numbers, and big integers. Return appropriate comparison
// results indicating if the first number is greater than, less than, or equal
// to the second number.
