// Parses a string from the input, starting and ending with the same quote character.
// Clears the current string buffer, then reads each character until it reaches the closing quote
// or a newline. If a newline or carriage return is encountered, the loop breaks and the function ends.
// Appends each character to the string buffer. Sets the current symbol to SSTRING after successfully
// parsing the quoted string. Moves to the next character after processing.
