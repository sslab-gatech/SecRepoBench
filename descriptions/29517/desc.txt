// Check if the structure defines its fields using the "MATLAB_fields" attribute.
// If the attribute exists, read the field names and update the number of fields.
// If the attribute does not exist, retrieve the number of links in the dataset group.
// If there are links, iterate over them to count and collect field names.
// Store the field names in the matvar structure and update the total number of fields.
