// Compare the current character in the input string with the current condition character.
// If they match, increment the position in the input string and advance to the next condition character.
// Handle multibyte UTF-8 characters if the option is set, ensuring the entire character sequence matches.
// If the input character matches within a group, mark that the character was found in the group.
// If the character does not match and is not within a group, return 0 to indicate the condition failed.
// Continue processing the condition string or group until the end of the string or group.
