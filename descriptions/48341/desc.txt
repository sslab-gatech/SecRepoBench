// Handle the reading of TIFF image data based on the specified method.
// For ReadStripMethod, read the image data by processing each strip of the TIFF file.
// Allocate memory to store strip data and iterate through each sample per pixel.
// Import the quantum pixels for each strip, updating the image's authentic pixels accordingly.
// For ReadTileMethod, read the image data by processing each tile of the TIFF file.
// Allocate memory to store tile data and iterate through each sample per pixel.
// Import the quantum pixels for each tile, ensuring the image's authentic pixels are updated.
// For ReadGenericMethod and default cases, read the image data using the TIFFReadRGBAImage function.
// This method processes the entire image at once, assigning the pixel values to the image's authentic pixels.
// For all methods, manage memory allocation and deallocation for the pixel data, ensuring efficient resource usage.
// Ensure progress is tracked and updated, allowing for cancellation if needed.
