// Ensure the input coordinate `x` is constrained within a specific range of valid values.
// If `x` is below the lower bound, return the lower bound; if `x` is above the upper bound,
// return the upper bound. Otherwise, return `x` unchanged. This helps to keep `x` within
// acceptable limits before returning it.
