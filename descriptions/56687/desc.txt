// This block implements a method that returns the current position of 
// the file descriptor associated with an IO object. It retrieves the 
// file pointer structure, then uses `lseek` to get the current 
// position. In the second snippet, it adjusts the returned position 
// based on the length of a buffer, which may have unread data.
