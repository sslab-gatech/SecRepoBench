// Define instance methods for the IO class to manage various IO operations,
// including copying, reading, writing, seeking, and closing the stream.
// Additional methods provide functionality to check the readability of the stream,
// determine if the stream is a terminal, and manage stream synchronization.
// These methods align with standard IO behaviors and enhance the IO class with
// capabilities such as checking if the stream is closed and managing execution state.
