// Identify arguments within a constructor that can be flattened, re-walk them, and replace
// nested constructors with their individual components. Create a new constructor with the
// flattened arguments and replace the original expression in the CFG and IR. Trigger a rescan
// if necessary. Reference counts remain unchanged, as no new references are added or removed.
