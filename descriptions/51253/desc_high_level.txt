// Perform key expansion to generate round keys for AES encryption or decryption.
// This involves iteratively modifying the temporary key array (tk) using the S-box
// and round constant (rcon) to produce keys for each round. If decrypting, apply
// inverse operations to the round keys to prepare them for the decryption process;
// otherwise, for encryption, reverse the order of round keys. Store the expanded
// keys into the 'round_key' array of the AVAES structure.
