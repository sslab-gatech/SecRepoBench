// Allocate memory for coefficients and points based on the number of coordinates and a quantum value.
// Calculate the number of control points to be used for Bezier curve computation.
// Check for memory allocation failure and handle errors if necessary.
// Ensure that the primitive extent can accommodate the computed control points.
