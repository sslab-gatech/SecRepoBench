// Retrieve essential TIFF header fields and properties, setting image attributes accordingly.
// Ensure valid bits per sample and sample format. Set image properties based on photometric interpretation.
// Handle specific cases like palette images, and allocate colormap if necessary.
// Parse and assign EXIF and other properties, such as chromaticity and resolution.
// Determine appropriate read method based on image characteristics (e.g., planar configuration and photometric type).
// Allocate memory for pixels, read image data, and convert to appropriate format for storage.
// Manage multi-frame images by reading the next TIFF directory and setting up the next image structure.
