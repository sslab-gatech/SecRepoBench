// Seek to the tag's location in the IO handler. Check if the tag is supported 
// by retrieving the tag descriptor for the given signature. If the tag descriptor 
// is not found, log an error and exit. Read the base type of the tag and verify 
// if it is supported by the tag descriptor. If the type is unsupported, exit. 
// Deduct 8 bytes from the tag size to account for the tag's base type header.
