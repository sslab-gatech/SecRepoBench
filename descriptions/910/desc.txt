// This function attempts to read a specified tag from an ICC profile.
// It first acquires a mutex for thread safety, then searches for the tag in the profile's tag directory.
// If the tag is already loaded in memory, it returns a pointer to the tag data.
// Otherwise, it seeks to the tag's location in the profile file, reads the tag's type base,
// and verifies if the tag type is supported. If supported, it uses the appropriate type handler
// to read and load the tag data into memory. Upon successful reading, it returns a pointer to the loaded data.
// If any error occurs during these operations, it releases the mutex and returns NULL.
