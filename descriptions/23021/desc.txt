// Initialize offsets for name parsing, starting after the body offset with a padding adjustment.
// Iterate through the payload to locate a specific ASN.1 identifier.
// If the name offset is within the valid payload length, proceed to extract the realm length.
// Adjust the offset to point to the realm string and ensure it fits within a predefined buffer size.
// Convert the realm string to lowercase and store it in the flow's Kerberos domain.
// If a packet buffer exists, free it and restore the packet's original payload and length.
// Set the packet buffer to NULL after processing.
