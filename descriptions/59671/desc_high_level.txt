// Implement motion compensation for various macroblock (MB) types including
// MV_TYPE_FIELD, MV_TYPE_16X8, and MV_TYPE_DMV. Each case handles motion
// compensation differently based on the picture structure and macroblock
// type. For field type, apply motion compensation separately for top and
// bottom fields when the picture is a frame, or adjust for field references
// when it's not. For 16x8 macroblocks, process each half of the macroblock
// separately, potentially adjusting reference pictures based on field
// selection and picture type. For dual-prime motion vectors (MV_TYPE_DMV),
// handle motion compensation with consideration to field structure and use
// different pixel operations when necessary. This logic integrates field
// selection and motion vector adjustments into the motion compensation process.
