// Handle different motion vector types for low-resolution motion compensation
// in the context of MPEG video decoding. The function processes macroblocks
// based on their motion vector type and updates the destination buffers 
// (luma and chroma) accordingly. The cases handled include field motion vectors
// (MV_TYPE_FIELD), 16x8 motion vectors (MV_TYPE_16X8), and dual-prime motion 
// vectors (MV_TYPE_DMV). The function performs separate operations based on 
// whether the picture is a frame or field picture, and adapts the reference 
// picture selection accordingly. Additionally, for DMV, it adjusts the 
// prediction by averaging with the opposite field. This setup allows efficient 
// handling of various motion compensation scenarios in low-resolution settings.
