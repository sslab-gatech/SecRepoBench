	// Function to parse SIMH tape files by examining records and tapemarks.
	// Iterates through the byte data, extracting
	// lengths using the `getlen` function and counting records and tapemarks.
	// Checks for the End of Medium (EOM) marker (0xFFFFFFFF) to terminate
	// parsing. If a data record length does not match its complementary
	// length, it returns 0 indicating invalid data. If the number of
	// tapemarks reaches the predefined limit `SIMH_TAPEMARKS`, it stops
	// processing further. Returns 1 if valid SIMH data is found, otherwise 0.
