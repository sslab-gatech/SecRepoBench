// Compare each character in the current position of the input pointer `uc`
// to the corresponding character in the `str` until the end of `str` is reached
// or a mismatch is found. If all characters match, proceed with the function,
// otherwise print a debug message indicating a failed match and return 0 to
// signal failure.
