// Assign the decompressed data from the block as the reference sequence for the slice.
// Set the start and end positions of this reference sequence based on the slice header.
// Check if the embedded reference is smaller than expected by comparing the slice's reference
// span with the decompressed block size. Log an error and return -1 if the reference is too small.
