// Set the slice's reference pointer to the uncompressed data of the block,
// and initialize the reference start and end positions based on the slice header.
// Check if the span of the reference sequence exceeds the available uncompressed
// data size of the block, logging an error and returning -1 if the reference is
// too small for the specified range.
