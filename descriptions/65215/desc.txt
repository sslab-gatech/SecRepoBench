// If the URL starts with "file://", adjust the path to remove the scheme prefix.
// For Windows-style paths, remove "file:///" by shifting the string position
// based on the presence of a drive letter (e.g., "C:") after the third slash.
// In the first snippet, the code checks if the 8th character is a slash and
// the 10th is a colon to identify a Windows drive letter, and adjusts accordingly.
// The second snippet includes an additional length check to ensure safety.
