// Define a macro to ensure sufficient memory is allocated for path arrays.
// Check if adding a specified padding to the current index would exceed the maximum allocated strokes.
// If so, increase the size of the allocated memory for path arrays or release memory and handle allocation failure.
// The macro is used throughout the function to dynamically adjust memory for path_p and path_q,
// ensuring they can accommodate additional points as the function processes each line segment.
