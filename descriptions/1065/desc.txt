// Execute the compiled regular expression against the given string.
// Ensure that the regex compilation was successful with an assertion.
// Optionally, initialize the pmatch array to zero before calling regexec,
// which matches the compiled pattern 'rx' against 'str'.
// The result is stored in pmatch, up to nmatch entries, with execution flags
// specified by eflags. Return the result of regexec function call.
