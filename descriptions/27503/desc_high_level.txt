// Decode audio data from the provided bitstream for a given element type.
// Depending on the tag value, handle different types of audio channels,
// such as mono, stereo, or other elements. For mono or LFE channels,
// decode the audio samples from either compressed or uncompressed frames,
// and write the output to the buffer, handling possible byte shifts and
// output formats (16, 20, 24, or 32-bit). For stereo channels, process
// both left and right channels similarly, possibly interleaving the data
// if necessary. Handle unsupported elements by setting the appropriate status.
// For certain elements like data stream or fill elements, parse but ignore
// their contents. Ensure the bitstream is byte-aligned at the end of the frame,
// and exit the loop once all channels are processed or when encountering an
// end frame tag.
