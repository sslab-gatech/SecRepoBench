// Decode audio data from the bitstream based on the element type specified by the tag.
// For mono or low-frequency elements, read and process header parameters, handling both compressed and uncompressed frames.
// For compressed frames, decompress data and apply prediction to reconstruct the audio samples.
// For stereo channel pairs, ensure channel limit is not exceeded and process each channel separately, similar to mono elements.
// Handle special cases such as partial frames and shifted values, reading them into appropriate buffers.
// For unsupported elements, set the status to indicate unsupported operations and ignore any fill elements.
// Finally, align the bitstream to byte boundaries and exit once all channels are processed or the frame end is reached.
