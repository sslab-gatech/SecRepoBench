// This section handles audio decoding for an ALAC decoder. It processes each element from the bitstream,
// determining the type of audio element (e.g., mono, stereo) and decoding the relevant data.
// The code uses a switch statement to handle different element tags, including single channel element (SCE),
// coupled channel element (CPE), data stream element (DSE), and fill element (FIL).
// For SCE and CPE, it decodes audio samples, applying necessary transformations and decompression, 
// then stores the results in output buffers. If an element is unsupported, it reports an error.
// The code ensures that buffer boundaries are respected and adjusts the number of samples if partial frames are detected.
// It also handles bit depth conversions and manages active elements within the decoder.
