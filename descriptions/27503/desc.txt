// This section of code serves as a safeguard to break out of the decoding loop
// once all channels have been processed, preventing further processing of
// any remaining data bits that do not correspond to audio data. The condition
// is wrapped in a preprocessor directive that allows enabling or disabling
// this check in non-debug or debug builds respectively. This ensures that
// in a production build, the code will stop decoding once the specified
// number of channels has been reached, thereby avoiding potential errors
// from unexpected data. In debug builds, the check can be disabled to allow
// for more rigorous testing and detection of issues with the bitstream.
