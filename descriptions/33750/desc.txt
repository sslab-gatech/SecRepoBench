// Free the original message pack buffer if it differs from the output buffer.
// Check if time resolution is needed by examining the parser's time format.
// Determine the time key to be used, defaulting to "time" if not specified.
// Calculate the length of the time key string.
// Iterate over the map's key-value pairs to find the time key.
// Compare each key's size and content to the desired time key.
// If the key matches and time should not be kept, note the index to skip.
// If no match is found, set pointers to NULL and continue the search.
