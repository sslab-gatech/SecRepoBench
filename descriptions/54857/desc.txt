// Align the width and height to the specified w_align and h_align values. 
// If the codec is H.264, VC1, WMV3, or a specific VP series codec, or if low 
// resolution is used, adjust the height by 2 to accommodate certain motion 
// compensation edge cases. Additionally, ensure that the width is at least 
// 32 for H.264, to provide enough temporary space for edge emulation during 
// out-of-frame motion vector processing.
