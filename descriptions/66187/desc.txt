// Check for UTF-8 multi-byte characters in a line of text.
// For 3-byte UTF-8 characters, ensure there is enough space in the conversion buffer and input line before processing.
// For 4-byte UTF-8 characters, similarly ensure sufficient space before processing.
// If there is not enough space, break the loop to prevent buffer overflow.
// If the character is not a multi-byte UTF-8 character, increment the input index and continue.
