// This code block handles the conversion of multi-byte UTF-8 characters to a custom internal format.
// It processes characters from the input string `szLine` and writes them into `szLineConv` while
// ensuring the proper handling of 2-byte, 3-byte, and 4-byte UTF-8 characters.
// For each UTF-8 character, it checks the first byte to determine the number of bytes in the character,
// then copies the appropriate number of bytes to `szLineConv`.
