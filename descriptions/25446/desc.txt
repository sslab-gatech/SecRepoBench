// Calculate the offset for the Kerberos realm data within the packet payload.
// Determine if the cname string represents a hostname or a username by
// checking if it ends with a '$'. If it does, strip the '$' and store it
// as a hostname. Otherwise, store it as a username in the flow structure.
// Increment the realm offset by scanning through the packet payload until
// a specific ASN.1 identifier is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
