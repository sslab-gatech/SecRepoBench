// Parse elements within a JSON array by iterating over each element until the end of the array is reached.
// Skip any whitespace.
// Attempt to parse the next JSON element; if parsing fails, exit the loop.
// After successfully parsing an element, check the next character to determine if it is a comma, indicating more elements, or a closing bracket, indicating the end of the array.
// If the end of the array is reached successfully, update the array count, print a success message, and update the position pointer.
// If an unexpected character is encountered or parsing fails at any point, exit the loop and handle the error.
