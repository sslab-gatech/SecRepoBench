// Check for the end of a JSON array during parsing. The code verifies
// if the current character being parsed is the closing bracket ']' 
// indicating the end of the array. In one variant of the implementation,
// it also checks if the parsing pointer has reached the end of the data
// buffer before checking for ']', ensuring no out-of-bounds access.
