// This code block is part of the JSON array parsing logic in a JSON parser.
// It checks if the current position in the input has reached the end of the 
// input data. If it has, it exits the parsing loop and proceeds to the 
// 'out' label for cleanup and error handling. The logic ensures that the 
// parser correctly identifies and processes the end of an array in a JSON 
// structure. The decision to include this check is based on the parsing 
// strategy where the loop continues until a valid ending condition for 
// a JSON array is encountered.
