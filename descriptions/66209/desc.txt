// This function performs a substring search using a bit manipulation technique.
// It compares the first and last characters of the target substring (`xs`) with
// possible positions in the search string (`ys`) using bitwise operations for efficiency.
// The function iterates through `ys` in chunks of machine word size (`bitint`).
// It calculates a mask for matching positions and checks equality for the first and last
// characters of the substring to quickly skip non-matching positions.
// If a potential match is found, it performs a `memcmp` for verification.
// It returns the byte index of the first occurrence of `xs` in `ys` or -1 if not found.
