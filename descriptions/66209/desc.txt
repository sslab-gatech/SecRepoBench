// This code block defines a function that performs a substring search using 
// a variation of the Two-Way algorithm. It utilizes SIMD (Single Instruction,
// Multiple Data) instructions for efficient parallel processing of byte sequences.
// Depending on the system architecture, it adjusts for 32-bit or 64-bit processing.
// 
// The function uses constants defined as bit masks to quickly identify potential 
// matches of the first and last characters of the substring within the target string.
// It then verifies these potential matches with a direct memory comparison.
//
// The loop iterates over the target string in chunks of 32 or 64 bits, using a 
// bitwise approach to efficiently detect positions where the substring may match.
// When a potential match is found, it performs a memcmp to confirm the substring 
// match.
//
// This implementation handles different endianness (big-endian and little-endian) 
// to accommodate various CPU architectures. It falls back to a naive search if 
// the target string is not large enough to utilize the SIMD approach effectively.
