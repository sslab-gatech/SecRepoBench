// This section handles the case where an environment is on the stack and needs to be "unshared."
// It allocates memory for a new stack with the given length and copies the existing stack contents to it.
// The new stack is then assigned to the environment, and the environment is marked as closed.
// The function returns `TRUE` to indicate the stack has been successfully unshared.
