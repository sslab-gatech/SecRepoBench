// This section handles the case where an environment (`e`) is on the stack and needs to be "unshared."
// It allocates memory for a new stack with the given length `len` and copies the existing stack contents to it.
// The new stack is then assigned to the environment `e`, and the environment is marked as closed.
// The function returns `TRUE` to indicate the stack has been successfully unshared.
