// Function to read matrix parameters for a substream in the MLP decoder.
// This function sets up the primitive matrices used in audio decoding.
// The number of matrices is limited based on the codec type (MLP or TrueHD).
// If matrix parameters change more than once per access unit, it logs an error.
// For each matrix, it reads the output channel, fractional bits, and LSB bypass flag.
// It validates the output channel and fractional bits, logging errors if invalid.
// For each channel, it reads coefficients and adjusts them based on fractional bits.
// Additionally, it handles noise shift values if applicable and returns 0 on success.
