// Declare necessary variables including status, footer_start, a pointer for buffer manipulation,
// output buffer size, a pointer for the output buffer, a z_stream structure for compression,
// and a variable for CRC checksum calculation.
// 
// Determine the maximum required size for the output buffer to store the compressed data.
// This calculation accounts for the potential worst-case size expansion due to compression.
// 
// Allocate memory for the output buffer based on the calculated maximum size.
