// This code implements the execution loop for the mruby virtual machine (VM).
// It sets up the VM for running Ruby bytecode, handling different instruction
// types, managing the VM stack, and invoking methods. The VM uses a dispatch 
// loop to interpret and execute bytecode instructions from the `irep` structure.
// The code includes exception handling to manage errors, as well as support 
// for method calls, control flow instructions like jumps, and arithmetic operations.
// It also handles special features such as lambdas, blocks, class/module definitions,
// and instance variables. The VM utilizes an arena for garbage collection efficiency
// and supports both direct-threaded and switch-based dispatching mechanisms.
