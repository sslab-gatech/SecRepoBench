// Define cases for extended opcodes OP_EXT1, OP_EXT2, and OP_EXT3. Each case
// reads the next byte as an instruction and uses a switch statement to handle
// the operation. The FETCH_x macros are used to retrieve the operation
// arguments, and execution jumps directly to the corresponding operation body.
// The program counter (pc) is decremented after execution to adjust for the
// instruction read. The `pc` update within each extension case ensures the
// correct instruction flow, especially when switching contexts or handling
// multiple instructions in one go.
