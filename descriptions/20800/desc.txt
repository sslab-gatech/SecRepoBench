// Determine the type of CodeView debug information by checking the signature.
// Depending on the signature, cast the header to the appropriate PDB structure.
// Extract the PDB file name from the structure if it fits within the PE bounds.
// Compute the length of the PDB path and ensure it's within valid limits.
// If a valid PDB path is found, store the path in the object associated with the PE.
// Stop further processing after successfully storing a valid PDB path.
