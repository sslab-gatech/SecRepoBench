// Case handlers for auxiliary fields of types 'H' and 'B' in BAM records.
// Handles 'H' type (hexadecimal string) by creating a new block if necessary,
// and encoding the data from the auxiliary fields.
// For 'B' type (byte array), computes the length based on the sub-type and count,
// allocates blocks as needed, and encodes the data.
// Checks for sufficient data remaining in the auxiliary field buffer before processing.
// Updates the auxiliary field pointer appropriately after encoding.
