// This code block processes BAM auxiliary data and stores it in CRAM format blocks. 
// It iterates over the BAM auxiliary fields, and based on the type identifier, 
// it extracts data and appends it to the appropriate CRAM block. 
// For simple data types (e.g., 'A', 'C', 'c'), it reads the immediate value 
// and appends it directly. For compound data types (e.g., 'B', 'Z', 'H'), 
// it computes the total length of the field and appends the entire field. 
// Additionally, the code ensures that each auxiliary field is stored in 
// an external block associated with its unique key identifier. 
// Proper error handling is present to manage insufficient data length or 
// unsupported types, logging an error and exiting gracefully when necessary.
