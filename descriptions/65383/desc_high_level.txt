// Handle auxiliary data of type 'H' and 'B' within the CRAM format.
// For 'H' type, it sets up the block for encoding and processes the hex
// string data until a null terminator is found, encoding it into the codec.
// For 'B' type, it reads the type and length of the data, calculates the
// byte length based on the type, and encodes the data using the BYTE_ARRAY_LEN
// method with external length. The setup ensures that necessary blocks are
// created for encoding the data, and the correct byte length is calculated
// based on the data type before encoding. Auxiliary data is then advanced
// to the next position after encoding.
