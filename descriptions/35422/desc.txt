// Concatenate the contents of a source StringInfo to a destination StringInfo.
// Ensure enough memory is allocated for the combined length of the two strings,
// including additional buffer space. Adjust the length of the destination string
// to reflect the concatenated result. Handle any memory allocation failures
// by throwing a fatal exception.
