// Determine the number of coordinates needed for each type of drawing primitive.
// - RectanglePrimitive: Multiply by 5 to account for rectangle's corners and closure.
// - RoundRectanglePrimitive: Use a helper function to get coordinates based on rounded edges.
// - BezierPrimitive: Check for a coordinate limit, and use a quantum multiplier.
// - PathPrimitive: Analyze the path string to count values, adjusting for Bezier complexity.
// - CirclePrimitive: Calculate using an assumed full circle.
// - ArcPrimitive: Calculate using center and radii derived from points.
// - EllipsePrimitive: Use a helper function to account for ellipse shape.
