// Handle CirclePrimitive and ArcPrimitive cases by calculating the number of coordinates for ellipses. 
// For CirclePrimitive, use a full 360-degree range to determine the ellipse coordinates based on the center and radius.
// For ArcPrimitive, calculate the center and radii from the given points and use the specified arc angle to determine the coordinates.
