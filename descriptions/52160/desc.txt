// Parse the server version from the string starting after a known prefix.
// Extract the version numbers into separate integers.
// Calculate a single version number from the extracted integers.
// Compare the version against predefined minimum version numbers.
// If the server version is below the minimum required version for Apache or nginx,
// set a risk level on the flow indicating an obsolete server version.
