// This code block is part of the LATM demuxer implementation within the GPAC framework.
// It is responsible for probing LATM data to determine if the stream is supported.
// The loop reads LATM frames from a bitstream and checks if the sample rate index is valid.
// It counts the number of frames read (`nb_frames`) while monitoring skipped bytes (`nb_skipped`).
// If more than one frame is successfully parsed with a valid sample rate, the probe score is set
// to indicate potential support for the stream.
