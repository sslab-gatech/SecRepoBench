// Attempt to synchronize and decode LATM frames from the bitstream using the latm_dmx_sync_frame_bs function.
// For each successful synchronization and decoding, check if the sample rate index is valid.
// If an invalid sample rate index is encountered, reset the frame count and exit the loop.
// Track the number of skipped frames; if more than one frame is skipped, reset the frame count and exit the loop.
// Increment the frame count for each successfully processed frame.
// This process continues until an error is detected or the end of the bitstream is reached.
