// Determine the size of the current MP3 frame using the parsed header information.
// Check if the frame is complete and ready to be processed. If the frame size plus additional bytes
// are within the remaining bytes after skipping, verify synchronization by checking if the next byte
// is not a sync byte (0xFF). If the next bytes match the ID3v1 tag signature, set a flag to skip the
// ID3v1 tag. Otherwise, log a message indicating an invalid frame and reset synchronization status,
// then skip to the next byte. If the frame is incomplete and there are more packets, wait for the
// next packet, unless it is the end of the stream.
