// This code block is responsible for processing MP3 data frames within a buffer.
// It searches for MP3 frame headers, handles ID3v2 tags, and extracts audio frames for playback.
// If an ID3v2 tag is detected, it reads the tag size and stores the tag data in a buffer.
// Once a complete MP3 frame is found, it synchronizes on the frame boundary and prepares a packet
// for further processing. It also manages frame synchronization, skipping invalid frames,
// and updating the current timestamp (CTS) based on the frame duration and sample rate.
// Furthermore, it checks for potential ID3v1 tags at the end of the stream and accounts for them.
// The function will continue to process the buffer until all frames are handled or an end-of-stream
// condition is reached.
