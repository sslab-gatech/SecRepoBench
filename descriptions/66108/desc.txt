// Check if the packet is ready to be sent. Verify if there's enough remaining data
		// to include a full frame plus a potential sync byte check.
		// Ensure synchronization by examining if the byte after the frame is 0xFF.
		// If the subsequent bytes indicate an ID3v1 tag ("TAG"), set a flag to skip it.
		// Otherwise, log a warning or debug message about the invalid frame and attempt to resync.
