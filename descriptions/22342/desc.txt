// Check if the packet is using TCP and perform initial validation of the payload.
// Determine the length of the TPKT protocol and verify if it matches the expected length.
// Inspect specific payload byte values to distinguish between H.323 and RDP protocols.
// Increment the count of valid H.323 packets and identify H.323 broadcast if conditions are met.
// For UDP packets, compute source and destination ports and validate the payload structure.
// Identify H.323 broadcasts by checking specific byte patterns and packet length.
// Exclude non-H.323 protocols from detection if conditions are not satisfied.
