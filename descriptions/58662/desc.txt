// Iterate over the remaining elements in the iterator, processing each glyph ID and class pair.
// For each pair, check if it is a continuation of the current range.
// If it is not a continuation, finalize the current range, and create a new range record for the new pair.
// Copy the new range record into the serialization context.
// Update previous glyph ID and class values for the next iteration.
// After the loop, finalize the last range record by setting its last glyph ID.
// Update the range record length to reflect the number of ranges processed.
// Sort the range records to handle any unsorted glyph order.
// Return true to indicate successful serialization.
