// Allocate memory for a Unicode string based on the UnicodeCount and read the Unicode string
// from the io handler. Set this string in the mlu object using wide character encoding.
// Free the Unicode string memory after use. Adjust the remaining size of the tag to account
// for the Unicode data. If additional script code data is present, skip it by reading and
// discarding the required amount from the io handler. If successful, set *nItems to 1 and
// return the mlu object. If any error occurs, handle it by freeing allocated resources and
// returning NULL.
