// This function reads a text description tag from the input handler `io`.
// It handles both ASCII and Unicode text, allocating memory for and
// interpreting the strings accordingly. 
// - The function starts by reading the ASCII string length and content.
// - It ensures the ASCII string is null-terminated before storing it in an MLU object.
// - It then reads the Unicode portion, if available, and stores it as well.
// - The function also manages optional ScriptCode data by skipping it if present.
// - Upon successful reading, it returns a pointer to the MLU object; 
//   otherwise, it handles errors by freeing allocated resources.
