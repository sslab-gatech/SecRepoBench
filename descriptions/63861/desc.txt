// Read and handle the Unicode string component of a text description. 
// Allocate memory to store the Unicode string based on UnicodeCount and read the characters from the IO handler. 
// Check if there is enough data left to process the Unicode string and allocate a buffer for it. 
// Convert the Unicode string to a wide character array and add it to the MLU (Multi-Language Unicode) structure. 
// After processing the Unicode string, adjust the remaining size of the tag data and check for the presence of optional ScriptCode elements. 
// If present, skip over the ScriptCode data by reading and discarding the necessary bytes. 
// Return the populated MLU object and handle any potential errors, ensuring allocated memory is freed if an error occurs.
