// Decode the coefficient value using a lookup table indexed by the number of bits
// and the extracted value. Adjust the coefficient based on its position in the block;
// if the position is less than 3, multiply the coefficient by 16, otherwise, scale the
// coefficient by the quantization scale and divide by a factor to adjust for the IDCT
// behavior differences. Assign the computed coefficient to the corresponding position
// in the block, applying a permutation using the scan table.
