// Calculate the coefficient using a lookup table and adjust it based on
// the position within the block and a quality scale. The lookup table 
// `vlcdec_lookup` provides values for different bit lengths and decoded 
// values. For the first three positions, the coefficient is multiplied by 16.
// For other positions, the coefficient is scaled by `qscale` and divided by 
// 1001 to account for differences in FFmpeg's inverse discrete cosine 
// transform (IDCT) behavior compared to the original implementation.
