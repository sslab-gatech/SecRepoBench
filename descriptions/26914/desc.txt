// Implement the LocaleLowercase function which converts a given character to its lowercase form.
// First, check if the character is EOF, and return it directly if true.
// If MAGICKCORE_LOCALE_SUPPORT is defined and a C locale is available, use tolower_l() with c_locale to convert the character.
// Otherwise, use the standard tolower() function to perform the conversion.
// The function should ensure that the character is within valid unsigned char range before conversion.
