// Convert a character to lowercase, considering locale settings if available.
// If the character is EOF, return it unchanged. In certain implementations,
// if the character is not an unsigned char, it is also returned unchanged.
// If locale support is enabled and a C locale is available, use the locale-
// specific function to convert the character to lowercase.
