// Parse specific HTTP header lines from the current packet line.
// Extract the "Authorization" header value, trimming any leading spaces.
// Recognize and parse other common HTTP header fields such as "Accept",
// "Referer", "User-Agent", "Content-Encoding", "Transfer-Encoding",
// "Content-Length", "Content-Disposition", "Cookie", "Origin",
// "X-Session-Type", and "Content-Type".
// For each recognized header, set the appropriate pointer and length fields
// in the packet structure to point to the header's value within the payload.
// Increment the count of HTTP headers in the packet structure for each
// recognized header.
// Identify unrecognized header lines by comparing them against a list of
// common headers and increment the header count for them as well.
// Specifically handle and parse the "Content-Type" header even if it lacks
// a space after the colon.
