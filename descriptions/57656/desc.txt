// Depending on the platform, the code checks for the existence of a file 
// at the given path. On Windows, it uses the `_wstat64` function to get 
// the file status. On other platforms, there are two possible implementations:
// 1. It attempts to open the file in read-binary mode using `fopen` and 
//    returns false if the operation fails, or closes the file if it succeeds.
// 2. It uses the `stat` function to retrieve the file status and checks 
//    if the file is a regular file using `S_ISREG`.
