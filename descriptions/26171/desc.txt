// Calculate the number of streams and elements per block based on the context
// and determine whether to split the compressed data into multiple streams.
// Prepare destination buffer depending on whether filters are applied.
// Iterate over each stream and for each stream, read the compressed size and
// decompress the data using the appropriate decompression format.
// Handle cases of runs, uncompressed data, or compressed data based on the
// compressed byte size.
// Accumulate the total number of compressed and uncompressed bytes for the block.
// If successful, the number of uncompressed bytes is returned; otherwise,
// appropriate error codes are returned to indicate failure.
