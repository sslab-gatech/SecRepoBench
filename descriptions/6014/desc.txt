// Iterate over the normalized string to remove leading spaces from each word.
// Use a character pointer to traverse through the string.
// Use a loop to skip over and remove consecutive spaces.
// Compact the string by shifting non-space characters to the left.
// Continue this until the end of the string is reached.
// If the last character is a space, terminate the string before the space.
