// This block handles the transition of all live objects, including old ones, to the white color during garbage collection. 
// The generational mode is temporarily disabled to reset the state, allowing the incremental sweep and finish processes 
// to occur. After completing the sweep, the generational mode is re-enabled to continue with the generational garbage collection process.
