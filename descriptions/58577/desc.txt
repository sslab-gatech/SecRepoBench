// Ensures that all objects in the mruby garbage collector (GC) are reset to
// the young generation state. If the GC is in the 'full' state, it first
// completes any ongoing garbage collection cycle. It then prepares a sweep
// phase to clean up dead objects and resets the color of all live objects,
// including old objects, to white. This process effectively clears the gray 
// object lists, ensuring that generational marking starts fresh in subsequent
// cycles.
