// This function implements the unpacking of BER (Basic Encoding Rules)
// encoded integers from a byte array. It reads bytes from the source
// `src` and decodes them into an integer `n` by processing 7 bits at a
// time, continuing until a byte with the most significant bit (MSB) not
// set is encountered. It stores the result in the array `ary`. The
// function handles potential overflow by checking if `n` exceeds a
// certain threshold (shifted MRB_INT_MAX) before shifting. It returns
// the number of bytes processed.
