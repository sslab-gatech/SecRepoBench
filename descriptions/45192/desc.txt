// This code block is responsible for unpacking a BER-compressed integer from a byte array.
// Each byte in the source data contributes 7 bits to the final value, with the 8th bit indicating if
// more bytes follow. If a byte's 8th bit is clear, the value is complete. The code raises an
// exception if the integer is invalid.
