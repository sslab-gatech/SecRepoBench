// Iterate over the bytes in the source buffer, decoding a BER encoded integer.
// Shift and accumulate the 7-bit values from the source bytes into the integer `n`.
// If a continuation bit is not present in a byte, exit the loop as the integer is fully read.
// Raise a range error if an overflow condition is detected during the decoding process.
// Track the number of bytes processed with the counter `i`.
