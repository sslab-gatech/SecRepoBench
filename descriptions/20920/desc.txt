// Check if the TIFF file is byte-swapped and, if so, swap the byte order of the IPTC profile data.
// For Snippet 2, retrieve the TIFF field associated with the IPTC tag and determine the data type.
// If the data type is TIFF_LONG, adjust the length accordingly before reading the IPTC profile into the image.
// Otherwise, read the IPTC profile directly using the given length.
