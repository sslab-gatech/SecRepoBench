// Process the IPTC profile data obtained from the TIFF image. If the TIFF
// data is byte-swapped, correct the byte order for the profile data.
// Determine the appropriate length for reading the profile based on the
// data type associated with the IPTC tag, and read the IPTC profile into
// the image object, updating the status accordingly.
