// Select the appropriate character map (encoding) for the font face based on
// the provided encoding string. If an encoding is specified, determine the
// corresponding FreeType encoding type using a series of string comparisons.
// If the encoding type is successfully determined, apply it to the font face.
// If the encoding type cannot be applied, handle the error by cleaning up
// resources and throwing an exception.
// 
// Set the character size for the font face based on the point size and
// resolution specified in the DrawInfo structure. Adjust the resolution
// if a custom density is provided. If setting the character size fails,
// handle the error by cleaning up resources and throwing an exception.
// 
// Initialize the TypeMetric structure with font size metrics such as ascent,
// descent, width, height, and maximum advance. If necessary, sanitize any
// incorrect ascender and descender values. Calculate underline position and
// thickness based on the font's properties.
// 
// If there is no text to render, or no glyphs in the font, clean up resources
// and return a successful status without proceeding further.
// 
// Configure rendering options such as anti-aliasing and hinting based on
// the DrawInfo settings and image properties. Prepare structures for
// rendering each glyph in the text string, transforming the glyphs according
// to specified affine transformations.
// 
// Loop through each character in the text, rendering glyphs, tracing outlines
// if necessary, and rasterizing the glyphs onto the image. Adjust the
// position and metrics of each rendered glyph, and update the bounding box
// of the text as needed. Manage resources and synchronize image data
// appropriately during the rendering process.
// 
// Finalize the font metrics by normalizing the bounding box coordinates and
// width. Clean up any remaining resources and return the rendering status.
