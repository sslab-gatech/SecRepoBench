// Validate the number of primitive matrices against the maximum allowed.
// For each primitive matrix, read the output channel, fractional bits,
// and whether LSBs should be bypassed. If the output channel exceeds the
// max matrix channel or the fractional bits exceed 14, log an error and
// return an error code. If the noise type is not set, adjust the max
// channel to account for additional noise channels. For each channel,
// read a coefficient value, multiplying it by a power of two based on
// the fractional bits. If noise type is set, read and store the matrix
// noise shift value, otherwise set it to zero. If any validation fails
