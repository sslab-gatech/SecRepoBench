// Validate the number of primitive matrices against the maximum allowed value.
// For each primitive matrix, read and validate properties such as output channel,
// fractional bits, and least significant bit bypass flag from the bitstream.
// Ensure output channel and fractional bits are within valid ranges.
// Calculate and store matrix coefficients for the channel, scaling them based on
// the fractional bits read. If noise is enabled, retrieve the noise shift value;
// otherwise, set it to zero. Handle errors by resetting the number of matrices
// and returning an error code.
