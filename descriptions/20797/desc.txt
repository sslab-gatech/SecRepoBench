// Parse the TLS handshake message from the packet to determine whether it is a Client Hello or Server Hello.
// Depending on the type of handshake message, extract relevant information such as cipher suites and TLS extensions.
// For a Server Hello, adjust offsets based on the session ID length and extract the server's cipher suite.
// For a Client Hello, parse the cipher suites and extensions, skipping GREASE values, and extract supported versions and other extension information.
// Construct a JA3 string based on extracted details, including TLS version, cipher suites, and extensions for fingerprinting purposes.
// Compute an MD5 hash of the JA3 string for both Client and Server handshakes to create a unique JA3 fingerprint.
// Store the computed JA3 hash in the flow structure for later analysis or comparison.
// Return a specific code to indicate the type of handshake processed, or zero if parsing was unsuccessful.
