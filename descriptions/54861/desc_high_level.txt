// Adjust the width and height based on specific codec requirements.
// For certain codecs, such as H264, VC1, WMV3, and various VP6 versions,
// increase the height to account for optimized chroma motion compensation
// that reads additional lines. Ensure the width is large enough for H.264
// edge emulation needs by making it at least 32. Additionally, if the codec
// is SVQ3, ensure the width is also at least 32.
