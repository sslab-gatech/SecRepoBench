// This code block is responsible for aligning the line sizes for video frames. 
// It iterates over each of the data pointers (up to 4) and sets their alignment 
// using the `STRIDE_ALIGN` constant. Additionally, in the second snippet, a check 
// is included for the codec ID `AV_CODEC_ID_SVQ3` to ensure a minimum width of 32 pixels. 
// This adjustment is specific to the SVQ3 codec to handle particular alignment requirements.
