// Assert that the draw_info is not NULL.
// Log the beginning of the draw-dash operation if debugging is enabled.
// Determine the number of vertices in the primitive_info array until an UndefinedPrimitive is encountered.
// Allocate memory for the dash_polygon array.
// If memory allocation fails, return MagickFalse to indicate failure.
// Clone the draw_info settings to a new DrawInfo structure, clone_info, and reset its miter limit.
// Initialize the first element of dash_polygon with the first element of primitive_info.
// Calculate the scale factor from the affine transformation in draw_info.
// Compute the initial length based on the scaled first dash pattern element minus a constant value.
// Compute the offset based on the scaled dash offset from draw_info, considering a minimum threshold.
