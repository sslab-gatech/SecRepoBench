// Check and verify the unpack length of the source data against the expected length.
// Initialize pointers to iterate over the source data. Set the `count` of bits to unpack,
// defaulting to the total number of bits in the source if not explicitly specified.
// Create a new mutable string to store the unpacked binary data with the specified count.
