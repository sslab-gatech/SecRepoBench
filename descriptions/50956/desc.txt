// Verify if the input and output channels of the matrices involved 
// are equal to 3. If not, return FALSE indicating the optimization 
// cannot be applied. This ensures the function operates only on RGB 
// to RGB transformations, which are characterized by having exactly 
// 3 input and output channels.
