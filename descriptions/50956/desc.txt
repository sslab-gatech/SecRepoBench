// Retrieve matrix data from two matrix stages within the LUT pipeline.
// Ensure input offset of the first matrix is zero before proceeding.
// Multiply the two matrices to compute the resultant matrix.
// Check if the resultant matrix, combined with the second matrix's offset, is an identity matrix.
// If so, mark the matrix as an identity to optimize or remove redundant computations.
// Note: RGB to RGB optimization is considered; handle offset conditions accordingly.
