// Log that a memcached search is being performed.
// Determine if the packet uses TCP or UDP.
// For TCP packets, check if the packet length meets the minimum required length.
// For UDP packets, check if the packet length meets the minimum required length.
// If UDP, verify specific header conditions to determine protocol compliance.
// Adjust the offset and length for UDP packets by skipping the UDP header length.
// Update the `matches` pointer to point to the appropriate memcached matches counter
// within the flow structure based on the protocol type.
// If the packet does not meet the expected criteria, exclude the protocol and return.
