// This function writes 16-bit entries from a set of tone curves to a given I/O handler. 
// It iterates over each curve and writes its entries sequentially.
// The number of entries per curve can either be fixed or variable depending on the snippet.
// It returns FALSE if writing any entry fails, otherwise TRUE on success.
