// Iterate over each curve in the `Tables` structure and write each entry
// to the `io` handler. The number of entries in each curve is determined
// and each entry is retrieved from the `Table16` array. The value of each
// entry is then written as a 16-bit unsigned integer. If writing any entry
// fails, the function returns `FALSE`.
