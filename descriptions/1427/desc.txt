// Check if the video size is sufficient based on the aligned width, height,
// and bits per pixel (bpp). Return an error if it is not.
// Determine the appropriate pixel format for the AVCodecContext based on
// encoding, palette size, bits per pixel, and video format. If the video is
// unencoded, has a palette, and uses <= 8 bpp, set the pixel format to PAL8.
// If the video is encoded with bpp of 6 or 8 and the palette size matches,
// set the pixel format to BGR24. If the video is unencoded, uses 24 bpp, is
// in CHUNKY format, and has no palette, set the pixel format to RGB24.
// If the format is unsupported, request a sample and return a patch-welcome
// error to indicate the need for further support.
