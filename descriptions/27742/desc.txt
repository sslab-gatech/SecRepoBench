// Extract the root object from the unpacked result and ensure it is an array
// with exactly two elements: a timestamp and a record. If these conditions
// are not met, skip the current iteration. Unpack the timestamp using a helper
// function and assign the second element of the array to a map object. Determine
// the size of the map. If a date key is provided, increment the map size by one
// to accommodate the additional date field when packing into the temporary
// message pack buffer; otherwise, use the original map size for packing.
