// Check if the main dictionary has a subdictionary.
// If a subdictionary exists, compute the hash value for the provided name,
// using either the name alone or the combination of prefix and name,
// depending on whether a prefix is given.
// Attempt to find an existing entry in the subdictionary using the computed hash value.
// If an entry is found in the subdictionary, return that entry.
