// Update code lengths and symbol processing for Huffman decoding.
// - For each symbol, determine its code length.
// - If the code length is non-zero and less than a predefined threshold,
//   update minimum and maximum code lengths and increment the count for that length.
// - If the code length indicates a short zero-code run, adjust the symbol index accordingly.
// - If it indicates a long zero-code run, read additional bits for the run length,
//   then adjust the symbol index by this computed length.
