        // This function cleans up a given file path by performing various operations to standardize it.
        // It first checks if the input string is empty and returns if so. It then removes leading spaces
        // or new lines from the path. The function iterates through each character in the path to 
        // replace both forward slashes ('/') and backslashes ('\\') with the operating system's 
        // directory separator. It ensures double delimiters are reduced to single delimiters and 
        // handles special cases such as skipping over "://" and "\\\\" sequences. Additionally, it
        // detects and converts hexadecimal sequences (e.g., %20) in URIs to their respective characters.
