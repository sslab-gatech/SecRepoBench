// Retrieve the next argument and convert it to a double precision float.
// Check if the float value is finite. If the value is NaN (Not a Number) or
// Infinity, prepare to format it as "NaN" or "Inf" respectively, 
// including potential sign handling ('+' or ' ' for positive numbers if specified).
// Calculate the number of characters needed for representation, considering any specified
// width and flags. If the width is greater than the calculated size, adjust accordingly.
// Handle padding and alignment (left or right) based on flags before storing the result
// in the buffer.
