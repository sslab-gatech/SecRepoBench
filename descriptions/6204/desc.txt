// This code block is responsible for parsing color specifications given in
// formats such as "rgb(100,255,0)" or "icc-color(profile,100,255,0)", and
// assigning the parsed values to a PixelInfo structure. It handles various
// colorspaces such as RGB, CMYK, HSL, and ICC profiles. The function first
// extracts the colorspace keyword from the input string, and then parses
// the color values enclosed in parentheses. The values are scaled accordingly
// based on the colorspace and stored in the PixelInfo structure. Additionally,
// the block checks for specific conditions like percentage values and alpha
// channels, and adjusts the color information appropriately. If the specified
// colorspace is not recognized, it throws an exception indicating the error.
