// Iterate over the candidate reference picture lists (ST_CURR_BEF, ST_CURR_AFT, LT_CURR).
// For each candidate list, append its references to a temporary reference picture list (rpl_tmp).
// Ensure the list does not exceed the maximum number of references allowed (HEVC_MAX_REFS).
// If the current picture reference is enabled by the PPS, add the current picture as a reference,
// ensuring that the addition does not exceed HEVC_MAX_REFS.
