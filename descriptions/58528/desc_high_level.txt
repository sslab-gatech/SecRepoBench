// Populate the temporary reference picture list (rpl_tmp) by iterating
// over the candidate reference picture sets specified in cand_lists.
// Append the references from each candidate set to rpl_tmp, while
// ensuring the total number of references does not exceed the maximum
// allowed. Additionally, if the current picture reference is enabled
// in the Picture Parameter Set, add the current picture as a long-term
// reference to the rpl_tmp list. This step consolidates potential
// reference pictures for the slice into a single list for further
// processing.
