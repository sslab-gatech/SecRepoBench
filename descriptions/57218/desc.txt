// Parse a node line from the SMD file and handle potential errors.
// Extract the bone index and ensure it is valid, resizing the bone
// list if necessary. Capture and store the bone name, which may be
// enclosed in quotation marks. Parse the parent index of the bone,
// checking for expected EOF/EOL conditions, and handle any errors
// by logging warnings or throwing an exception, depending on the
// snippet version. The logic ensures that the parsed information
// conforms to expected structure and formats within the SMD file.
