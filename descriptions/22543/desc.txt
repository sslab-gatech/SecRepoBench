// Calculate the scale factor and pixel value for the JP2 image component.
// The scale is determined by the quantum range divided by the maximum pixel
// value determined by the precision of the component. The pixel value is
// adjusted for signedness by adding an offset when the component is signed. 
// Optionally, the index into the component's data array is validated to ensure 
// it lies within the valid range, throwing an exception if out of bounds.
