// Calculate the scaled pixel value for each component of the JP2 image. The process involves adjusting for the component's precision and signedness, and determining the appropriate data index based on the image dimensions and component's subsampling factors. The scaled pixel value is then used to set the appropriate color channel for the current pixel in the output image. This calculation is part of converting the JP2 image's internal representation into a format suitable for further processing or display.
