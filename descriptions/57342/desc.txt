// If 'avar' data is present, obtain the segment maps for axis value remapping.
// Initialize variables to track axis indices and whether any axis is not pinned.
// Iterate over each axis in the 'axes' array.
// For each axis, get its tag and update the map from old index to tag.
// Check if the axis is present in the user's axis location settings.
// If the axis is not set by the user, mark it as not pinned and update the index map.
// If the axis is set by the user, normalize its value using user settings.
// If 'avar' data is available, remap the normalized value using the segment maps.
// Set the normalized value in the plan's axes location and coordinates.
// If the normalized value is not zero, mark the plan as not pinned at default.
// Update segment maps for 'avar' for the next axis, if applicable.
