// Process groups of three pixels from the input data, converting each to a grayscale value.
// For each group, extract three 10-bit values from a 32-bit pixel.
// Convert each extracted value to a quantum gray value and assign it to the output pixel array.
// Handle the remaining pixels if the total number of pixels is not a multiple of three.
