// Adjust the index `i` by advancing it by 8 bytes. Before doing so, check if the
// `size` is smaller than 8 or if advancing `i` by `size` would exceed the
// buffer size (`p->buf_size`). If either condition is true, return 0 to
// indicate that the probe is invalid or the data is insufficient for further
// processing.
