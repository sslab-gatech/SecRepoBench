// This code block probes the input data buffer to identify if it is a 3DO STR format.
// It reads chunks from the buffer, each identified by a tag and a size.
// The function checks if the buffer has valid control and sound chunks with required size.
// For the 'SNDS' chunk, it verifies the presence of a 'SHDR' subchunk and valid audio parameters.
// If these conditions are met, it returns a high probe score indicating a match.
// The loop handles unknown or unsupported chunks by skipping over them.
