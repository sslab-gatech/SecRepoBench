// Check for array modification and ensure that the shift operation can be performed.
// If the array length is zero or the number of elements to shift is zero, return a new empty array.
// Adjust the number of elements to shift if it exceeds the current array length.
// Create a new array from the values that are being shifted out.
// If the array is shared, update the internal pointer and length to reflect the shift,
// and return the newly created array containing the shifted elements.
