// Iterate through the payload to process STUN message attributes.
// For each attribute, determine its type and length and align the length to 4-byte boundaries.
// Depending on the attribute type, deduce the application protocol and set the guessed host protocol.
// If specific attributes associated with known protocols are found (like WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom, etc.),
// update the guessed protocol accordingly and return the result indicating the presence of STUN.
