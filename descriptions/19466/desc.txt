// Extract the server name from the TLS certificate payload.
// Check if the extracted server name appears to be a valid host name or IP address.
// If valid, store the server name in the flow's `server_certificate` field.
// Optionally, attempt to match the extracted server name to a known protocol.
// If a subprotocol is detected, set the flow's detected protocol accordingly.
// If a valid server name is extracted and optionally matched, return indicating success.
