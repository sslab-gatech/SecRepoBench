// Allocate memory for storing offsets of font dictionaries based on the offset size and count of font dictionaries.
// Initialize offset tracking variables for serialization of font dictionary offsets.
// Iterate through each font dictionary, checking if it is included in the remap.
// For included font dictionaries, set their respective offsets in a serializable format.
// Compute and accumulate the serialized size of each included font dictionary into the offset variable.
// Update the last offset to mark the end of the serialized data for font dictionaries.
