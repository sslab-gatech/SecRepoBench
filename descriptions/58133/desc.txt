// Parse the 'flags' string, interpreting it as a series of decimal numbers
// separated by commas. Convert each number to an unsigned short and store it
// in the 'result' array. Check if each number is within the allowable range,
// and issue warnings if any numbers are too large or zero. Update the 'src'
// pointer to track the start of the next number after each comma.
