// Read EXIF properties from a TIFF image if available.
// The function retrieves the EXIF data if the TIFF has an EXIF IFD (Image File Directory).
// It iterates over predefined EXIF tags, extracts their values, and sets them as image properties.
// Handles various data types including ASCII, SHORT, LONG, and RATIONAL.
// Ensures the TIFF directory is reset to its original state after processing.
