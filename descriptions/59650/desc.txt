// Check if the input record is null; if so, return an uninitialized result record.
// Calculate the next TLV record by advancing the current record's base pointer by its total size.
// If the calculated record is invalid or out-of-bounds of the TLV memory range, reset it to null.
// Return the next TLV record or null if any invalid conditions are detected.
