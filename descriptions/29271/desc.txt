// Parse the input parameters to retrieve the serialized buffer and its length.
// Initialize variables needed for unserialization, including a hash for variable tracking.
// Check for expected buffer format and unserialize the count of elements in the buffer.
// Iterate through the serialized elements, checking for the correct format of each entry.
// For each element, unserialize it and optionally its associated information if present.
// Validate the unserialized data, ensuring it is an object, and retrieve or create a storage element.
// Manage references and memory for the unserialized entries, facilitating cross-references.
// Attach the unserialized elements and their information to the internal storage structure.
