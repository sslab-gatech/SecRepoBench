// Check if the current character in the condition is a ']'.
// If it's not, compare the current characters of the strip and condition.
// If they differ, output a warning and return 0.
// If it is a ']', check if the strip character is within the character set defined in the condition.
// Iterate backwards to find the matching '[' for the ']'.
// If the corresponding '[' is not found, output an error and return 0.
// Determine if the character set is negated by checking if the next character after '[' is '^'.
// Check if the strip character's presence in the set matches the negation status.
// If not, output a warning and return 0.
