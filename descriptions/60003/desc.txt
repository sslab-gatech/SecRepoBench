// Check the packet's payload against several specific patterns and lengths
// to determine if it matches known criteria for Line protocol packets.
// If a match is found, add the connection using ndpi_int_line_add_connection()
// to indicate that the flow is associated with the Line protocol, and exit
// the function early. These patterns involve checking specific byte values
// at certain payload offsets and comparing payload lengths.
