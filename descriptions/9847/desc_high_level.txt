// Parse the next character after a JSON object entry, which can either be a comma (indicating another key-value pair follows)
// or a closing brace (indicating the end of the object). If a comma is found, continue parsing the next key-value pair. If a
// closing brace is found, mark the object as successfully parsed and return success. If neither is encountered, update the
// cursor to the previous position and exit with an error.
