// This section parses the continuation of a JSON object after a key-value pair.
// It looks for a comma to continue parsing further key-value pairs or a closing
// brace to complete the JSON object. If a closing brace is found, the parsing
// of the object is considered successful, and control returns to the previous
// level. Otherwise, it signals an error if the next character
// is not a comma or closing brace.
