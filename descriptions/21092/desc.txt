// Check if the value is less than or equal to the first fromCoord and adjust accordingly.
// Iterate through the array to find the appropriate segment where the value should be mapped.
// If the value is beyond or equal to the current segment's fromCoord, adjust the value using the current segment's toCoord.
// Handle cases where two fromCoords are equal by using the previous toCoord for mapping.
// Calculate the denominator for linear interpolation between two segments.
