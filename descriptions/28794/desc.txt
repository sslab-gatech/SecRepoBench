// This code block optimizes swizzles applied to constructors in expressions.
// It checks if the base constructor has a single scalar argument and optimizes
// it by reducing the swizzle size. For more complex expressions, it maps the
// arguments of the constructor and counts their usage within the swizzle. It
// then determines if the swizzle can be optimized by ensuring that non-trivial
// expressions are not repeated and expressions with side effects occur exactly
// once. If safe, it reorders and simplifies the arguments, creating a new
// constructor expression that avoids unnecessary computation and duplication.
