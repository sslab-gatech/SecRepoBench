// Read the initial part of the ZIPX stream to extract the magic numbers
// and LZMA parameters. Ensure that the data format is as expected by
// validating specific byte values. If the format is incorrect or the data
// is truncated, set an appropriate error and return a failure code.
// Prepare an LZMA 'alone' header by copying the LZMA parameters from
// the ZIPX stream to the appropriate location in the header.
