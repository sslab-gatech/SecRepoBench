// This code block reads and processes a Postscript image file, extracting
// information from document structuring comments and embedded profiles.
// It handles various Postscript sections like ICC profiles, XMP profiles,
// and Photoshop profiles, reading these data into the Image structure.
// It also determines the image's rendering resolution and bounding box
// dimensions based on the document's comments. The function creates a
// control file for Ghostscript, which is then used to render the Postscript
// content into an Image object. The function handles different Postscript
// color spaces (CMYK, monochrome) and can fit the page to specified
// dimensions if needed. After rendering, it assembles the resulting images
// into a list, processing special requirements such as CMYK consolidation
// and scene management. Finally, it returns the first image in the list,
// or NULL if processing fails.
