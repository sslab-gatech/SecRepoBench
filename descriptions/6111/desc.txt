// This code block is responsible for reading a Postscript image file
// and returning it as an Image structure. It initializes necessary
// variables and structures, handles file operations, and processes
// Postscript comments and profiles. It also sets image properties like
// resolution, dimensions, and color settings. The block interacts with
// Ghostscript to render the Postscript content and creates a temporary
// Ghostscript control file for processing. It considers various Postscript
// elements such as bounding boxes, color spaces, and pages. The rendered
// Postscript content is then used to generate images, handling different
// profiles and properties as needed. The code block ensures cleanup of
// temporary resources and proper error handling throughout its execution.
