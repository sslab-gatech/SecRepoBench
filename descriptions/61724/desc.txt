// The code block initializes a hash map to store glyph variation data for new glyph IDs.
// It iterates over a list mapping new glyph IDs to old glyph IDs, setting the glyph variation 
// data for each new glyph ID using a helper function to retrieve the data for the corresponding 
// old glyph ID. If the first glyph ID is zero and the NOTDEF_OUTLINE flag is not set, it handles 
// this special case by associating a default empty data value for the ID zero in the map.
// After populating the map, it checks for errors, and then proceeds to call a method to 
// create glyph variations using the axis count and shared tuples, along with the plan and the 
// populated map of new glyph IDs to variation data.
