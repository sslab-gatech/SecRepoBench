// Extract metadata from the TIFF image by querying various TIFF tags
// (such as artist, copyright, datetime, etc.). For each tag that
// successfully retrieves a value, set the corresponding property
// on the image object using SetImageProperty. Some tags might have
// additional handling, such as converting values to strings or
// handling specific subfile types. This functionality enriches the
// image object with metadata present in the TIFF file.
