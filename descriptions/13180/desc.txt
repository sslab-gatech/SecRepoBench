// Retrieve various TIFF properties and set them as image properties.
// These properties include artist, copyright, timestamp, document name,
// host computer, image description, make, model, image ID, page name,
// software, and additional custom tags. Each property is fetched using
// TIFFGetField, and if present, stored in the image properties for later
// use. The subfile type is also checked and set accordingly.
