// Extract TIFF properties using TIFFGetField and set corresponding
// image properties. Fetches various metadata like artist, copyright,
// datetime, document name, host computer, image description, make, model,
// OPI image ID, page name, and software, storing them as image properties.
// Also retrieves custom properties and subfile type to set specific
// image attributes. Ensures text strings are copied safely by bounding
// their length to the defined maximum.
