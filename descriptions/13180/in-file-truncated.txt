  // Retrieve and set image properties from TIFF tags.
  // This block of code attempts to extract various metadata fields from a TIFF image,
  // such as artist, copyright, document name, and other descriptive fields.
  // Each TIFF field is checked for existence and non-null value, and if so, it is
  // set as an image property using the SetImageProperty function. Special handling
  // is done for fields like OPIIMAGEID, with count validation and string copying.
  // Additionally, it handles the subfiletype field with specific values like REDUCEDIMAGE,
  // PAGE, and MASK. This code can be adapted to include new properties or handle
  // additional TIFF tags as needed.
