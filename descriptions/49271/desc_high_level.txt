// Copy a rectangular block of pixels from the source buffer to the destination buffer.
// The dimensions of the block are specified by 'width' and 'height', and the memory
// layout is determined by 'stride_src' and 'stride_dst'. This implementation is used
// when the memory addresses or strides are not aligned to a 16-byte boundary.
// The function iterates over each row and copies segments of 8 bytes at a time.
// If there are any remaining bytes at the end of a row that do not form a complete
// 8-byte segment, they are copied individually.
