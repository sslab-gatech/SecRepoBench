// This code block is responsible for copying a block of pixels from a source 
// buffer to a destination buffer, iterating over the height of the block. 
// It uses a stride for both the source and destination to handle different 
// row alignments. The loop iterates over the width of the block in chunks 
// of 8 pixels, utilizing the AV_COPY64U function for optimized 64-bit 
// unaligned memory copy operations. The loop handles the case where 
// the memory addresses and strides are not aligned to 16-byte boundaries. 
// Depending on the implementation choice, the block can either handle
// remaining unaligned pixels within the loop or handle the remainder separately.
