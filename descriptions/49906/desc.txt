// Update the protocol detection stack in the flow structure. If the second protocol
// in the stack is unknown, and the current guessed protocol has no subprotocols,
// set the first protocol in the stack to the guessed host protocol, and the second
// to the guessed protocol. If the second protocol is already detected, ensure that
// the guessed protocol and guessed host protocol match the detected protocols in the stack.
