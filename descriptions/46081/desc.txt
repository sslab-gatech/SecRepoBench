// Calculate the size of the quantum pixel buffer based on the image dimensions,
// number of pixel channels, and quantum depth. The computation determines the
// `quantum` variable by considering the number of pixel channels, padding, and
// quantum depth, accounting for byte alignment. The `extent` is then calculated
// as the product of the maximum of the image's columns and rows, and the 
// `quantum` to ensure sufficient memory allocation for the pixel buffer.
