// This code block sets the quantum depth and allocates the quantum pixel buffer
// for image processing. It begins by asserting the validity of the input image
// and quantum_info structures, ensuring they have the correct signatures and are
// not NULL. The depth is set to a minimum of the given depth and 64. If the
// quantum format is FloatingPoint, the depth is further adjusted to standard
// floating-point sizes (16, 24, 32, or 64 bits). The quantum size is calculated
// based on pixel channels, padding, and the quantum depth. The extent is
// determined by the maximum of image columns and rows, multiplied by the quantum
// size. It checks for overflow in the extent calculation and ensures the quantum
// pixel buffer is allocated only if the required extent exceeds the existing
// extent. If the buffer already exists and has sufficient size, it returns true;
// otherwise, it destroys the existing buffer and acquires a new one.
