// Calculate the size of the quantum pixel buffer needed for the image based on its dimensions,
// the number of pixel channels, padding, and the specified quantum depth. The calculated values
// are stored in the 'quantum' and 'extent' variables, which are used to ensure that the buffer
// is appropriately allocated for the image's quantum information.
