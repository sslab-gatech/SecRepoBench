// Increment the total compressed bytes counter by 1 for the token
// Check if the token indicates a run of non-zero bytes
// If so, validate that the run length does not exceed a specific limit
// Use the token to determine the byte value for the run and fill the destination buffer with it
// Set decompressed bytes to the number of elements in the block
// Ensure the compressed bytes for this stream is zeroed, as it is fully encoded in the token
