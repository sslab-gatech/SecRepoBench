// Iterate over a collection of ranges to map glyphs to SIDs.
// For each range, retrieve the starting SID and determine the number of consecutive SIDs to map.
// For each SID in the range, map the current glyph identifier to the SID.
// Increment the glyph identifier with each mapping until it reaches the total number of glyphs.
// Exit the loop when the maximum number of glyphs is reached.
