// Check if the current tag should be processed based on the `all` flag or if it matches the target tag. 
// If a match is found, extract the EXIF data from the current directory entry. 
// The data is extracted according to the specified format, which could be byte, short, long, rational, 
// or a string, among others. Depending on the format, read the appropriate number of bytes from the 
// EXIF data and format them as a string. If the data matches specific GPS tags, format them differently. 
// Once the value is extracted, generate a key for the property based on the EXIF tag and the current level. 
// Store the formatted value into the image properties, ensuring no duplicate entries exist.
