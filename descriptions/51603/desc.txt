// This function parses a strength annotation line from a magic file
// and sets the corresponding factor operation and value in the magic
// entry. It begins by setting up variables and checking if a strength
// type is already defined. If the entry is of type FILE_NAME, it warns
// that strength settings are not supported. It reads the operation type
// and factor value, verifying that the factor is within valid limits
// and not combined with a division operation when zero. If errors are
// detected, it resets the factor operation and value to defaults.
