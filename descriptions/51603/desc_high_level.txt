// Initialize a pointer to the first magic structure in the magic entry array.
// Check if the current magic entry already has a strength operation defined,
// and if so, issue a warning and return an error. Ensure that the strength
// setting is not applied to "name" type magic entries, issuing a warning and
// returning an error if it is. Skip any whitespace in the input line. Determine
// the type of factor operation specified by the character at the current position
// in the input line and update the magic structure with this operation if it's valid.
// If the factor operation character is not recognized, issue a warning and return an error.
